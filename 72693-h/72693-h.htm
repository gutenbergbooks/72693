<p>By the recommendation of a number of their friends and agents,
<span class="smcap">Messrs Chambers</span> have been induced to reprint a selection of the
principal original articles of their <span class="smcap">Journal</span>; in order that such
individuals as might desire to possess those articles in a portable
shape, distinct from the mass of compilations and extracts with
which they were accompanied in the numbers, might be gratified
in their wish; and in order that this new series of Essays, in which
an attempt has been made, almost for the first time, to delineate
the maxims and manners of the middle ranks of society, might
have an opportunity, in the shape of a book, of attracting the
attention of those by whom it might be overlooked in its original
form and progressive mode of publication.</p>

<p>The articles embodied in the present volume are chiefly selected
from the forty earliest numbers of the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>. Should it be
favourably received, the authors will probably, from time to time,
throw further selections into the same form.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The Earl of Wigton, whose name figures in Scottish annals
of the reign of Charles the Second, had three daughters,
named Lady Frances, Lady Grizel, and Lady Jean—the
last being by several years the youngest, and by many degrees
the most beautiful. All the three usually resided
with their mother at the chief seat of the family, Cumbernauld
House, in Stirlingshire; but the two eldest were
occasionally permitted to attend their father at Edinburgh,
in order that they might have some chance of obtaining
lovers at the court held there by the Duke of Lauderdale,
while Lady Jean was kept constantly at home, and debarred
from the society of the capital, lest her superior
beauty might interfere with, and foil, the attractions of her
sisters, who, according to the notion of that age, had a
sort of <em>right of primogeniture</em> in matrimony, as well as in
what was called <em>heirship</em>.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that while the two marriageable
ladies were enjoying all the delights of a third flat in
one of the <em>closes</em> of the Canongate, spending their days in
seeing beaux, and their nights in dreaming of them, Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
Jean led no pleasant life amidst the remote and solitary
splendours of Cumbernauld, where her chief employment
was the disagreeable one of attending her mother, a very infirm
and querulous old dame, much given (it was said) to
strong waters. At the period when our tale opens, Lady
Jean’s charms, though never seen in the capital, had begun
to make some noise there; and the curiosity excited respecting
them amongst the juvenile party of the vice-regal
court, had induced Lord Wigton to confine her ladyship
even more strictly than heretofore, lest, perchance, some
gallant might make a pilgrimage to his country-seat in
order to behold her, and, from less to more, induce her to
quit her retirement, in such a way as would effectually
discomfit his schemes for the pre-advancement of his elder
daughters. He had been at pains to send an express to
Cumbernauld, ordering Lady Jean to be confined to the
precincts of the house and the <em>terrace-garden</em>, and to be
closely attended in all her movements by a trusty domestic.
The consequence was, that the young lady complained
most piteously to her deaf old lady-mother of the tedium
and listlessness of her life, and wished with all her heart
that she were as ugly, old, and happy as her sisters.</p>

<p>Lord Wigton was not insensible to the cruelty of his
policy, however well he might be convinced of its advantage
and necessity; he loved his youngest daughter more
than the rest; and it was only in obedience to what he
conceived to be the commands of duty, that he subjected
her to this restraint. His lordship, therefore, felt anxious
to alleviate in some measure the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">desagremens</i> of her solitary
confinement; and knowing her to be fond of music, he
had sent to her by the last messenger a theorbo lute,
with which he thought she would be able to amuse herself
in a way very much to her mind—not considering that,
as she could not play upon the instrument, it would be little
better to her than an unmeaning toy. By the return of
his messenger, he received a letter from Lady Jean, thanking
him for the theorbo, but making him aware of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
oversight, and begging him to send some person who could
teach her to play.</p>

<p>The earl, whose acquirements in the philosophy of politics
had never been questioned, felt ashamed of having
committed such a solecism in so trivial a matter; and, like
all men anxious to repair or conceal an error in judgment,
immediately ran into another of ten times greater consequence
and magnitude: he gratified his daughter in her
wish.</p>

<p>The gentry of Scotland were at that time in the custom
of occasionally employing a species of servants, whose accomplishments
and duties would now appear of a very
anomalous character, though at that time naturally arising
from the peculiar situation of this country, in respect to its
southern neighbour. They were, in general, humble men
who had travelled a good deal, and acquired many foreign
accomplishments; who, returning to their native country
after an absence of a few years, usually entered into the
service of the higher class of families, partly as ordinary
livery-men, and partly with the purpose of instructing the
youth of both sexes, as they grew up and required such
exercises, in dancing, music, writing, &amp;c., besides a vast
variety of other arts, comprehended in the general phrase
of <em>breeding</em>. Though these men received much higher
wages, and were a thousand times more unmanageable
than common serving-men, they served a good purpose in
those days, when young people had scarcely any other opportunities
of acquiring the ornamental branches of education,
except by going abroad. It so happened, that not
many days after Lord Wigton received his daughter’s letter,
he was applied to for employment by one of these
useful personages, a tall and handsome youth, apparently
five-and-twenty, with dark Italian-looking features, a slight
moustache, and as much foreign peculiarity in his dress
as indicated that he was just returned from his travels.
After putting a few questions, his lordship discovered
that the youth was possessed of many agreeable accomplishments;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
was, in particular, perfectly well qualified to
teach the theorbo, and had no objection to entering the service
of a young lady of quality—only, with the proviso that
he was to be spared the disgrace of a livery. Lord Wigton
then made no scruple in engaging him for a certain
period; and next day saw the youth on the way to Cumbernauld,
with a letter from his lordship to Lady Jean, setting
forth all his good qualities, and containing among other
endearing expressions, a hope that she would both benefit
by his instructions, and be in the meantime content on
their account with her present residence.</p>

<p>Any occurrence at Cumbernauld, of higher import than
the breaking of a needle in embroidering, or the miscarriage
of a brewing of currant wine, would have been quite
an incident in the eyes of Lady Jean; and even to have
given alms at the castle-gate to an extraordinary beggar,
or to see so much as a stranger in the candle, might have
supplied her with amusement infinite, and speculation
boundless. What, then, must have been her delight, when
the goodly and youthful figure of Richard Storie alighted
one dull summer afternoon at the gate, and when the credentials
he presented disclosed to her the agreeable purpose
of his mission! Her joy knew no bounds; nor did she
know in what terms to welcome the stranger: she ran from
one end of the house to the other, up stairs and down
stairs, in search of she knew not what; and finally, in her
transports, she shook her mother out of a drunken slumber,
which the old lady was enjoying as usual in her large
chair in the parlour.</p>

<p>Master Richard, as he was commonly designated, soon
found himself comfortably established in the good graces of
the whole household of Cumbernauld, and not less so in
the particular favour of his young mistress. Even the sour
old lady of the large chair was pleased with his handsome
appearance, and was occasionally seen to give a preternatural
nod and smile at some of his musical exhibitions, as
much as to say she knew when he performed well, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
was willing to encourage humble merit. As for Lady Jean,
whose disposition was equally lively and generous, she
could not express in sufficiently warm terms her admiration
of his performances, or the delight she experienced from
them. Nor was she ever content without having Master
Richard in her presence, either to play himself, or to teach
her the enchanting art. She was a most apt scholar—so apt,
that in a few days she was able to accompany him with the
theorbo and voice, while he played upon an ancient harpsichord
belonging to the old lady, which he had rescued
from a lumber room, and been at some pains to repair.
The exclusive preference thus given to music, for the time,
threw his other accomplishments into the shade, while it,
moreover, occasioned his more constant presence in the
apartments of the ladies than he would have been otherwise
entitled to. The consequence was, that in a short
time he almost ceased to be looked upon as a servant, and
began gradually to assume the more interesting character
of a friend and equal.</p>

<p>It was Lady Jean’s practice to take a walk prescribed
by her father, every day in the garden, on which occasions
the countess conceived herself as acting up to the letter
of her husband’s commands, when she ordered Master
Richard to attend his pupil. This arrangement was exceedingly
agreeable to Lady Jean, as they sometimes took
out the theorbo, and added music to the other pleasures of
the walk. Another out-of-doors amusement, in which
music formed a chief part, was suggested to them by the
appropriate frontispiece of a book of instruction for the
theorbo, which Master Richard had brought with him from
Edinburgh. This engraving represented a beautiful young
shepherdess, dressed in the fashionable costume of that
period—a stupendous tower of hair hung round with diamonds,
and a voluminous silk gown with a jewel-adorned
stomacher, a theorbo in her arms and a crook by her side—sitting
on a flowery bank under a tree, with sheep planted
at regular distances around her. At a little distance appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
a shepherd with dressed hair, long-skirted coat, and
silk stockings, who seemed to survey his mistress with a languishing
air of admiration, that appeared singularly ridiculous,
as contrasted with the coquettish and contemptuous
aspect of the lady. The plate referred to a particular song in
a book, entitled “A Dialogue betwixt Strephon and Lydia,
or the Proud Shepherdess’s Courtship,” the music of which
was exceedingly beautiful, while the verses were the tamest
and most affected trash imaginable. It occurred to Lady
Jean’s lively fancy, that if she and her teacher were to
personify the shepherdess and shepherd, and thus, as it
were, to transform the song to a sort of opera, making the
terrace-garden the scene, not a little amusement might be
added to the pleasure she experienced from the mere music
alone. This fancy was easily reduced to execution; for,
by seating herself under a tree, in her ordinary dress, with
the horticultural implement called a rake by her side, she
looked the very Lydia of the copper-plate; while Richard,
standing at his customary respectful distance, with his handsome
person, and somewhat foreign apparel, was a sufficiently
good representation of Strephon. After arranging
themselves thus, Master Richard opened the drama by
addressing Lady Jean in the first verse of the song, which
contained, besides some description of sunrise, a comparison
between the beauties of nature at that delightful period,
and the charms of Lydia, the superiority being of course
awarded to the latter. Lady Jean, with the help of the
theorbo, replied to this in a very disdainful style, affecting
to hold the compliments of lovers very cheap, and asseverating
that she had no regard for any being on earth besides
her father and mother, and no care but for these dear
innocent sheep (here she looked kindly aside upon a
neighbouring bed of cabbages), which they had entrusted
to her charge. Other verses of similar nonsense succeeded,
during which the representative of the fair Lydia could not
help feeling rather more emotion at hearing the ardent addresses
of Strephon than was strictly consistent with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
part. At the last it was her duty to rise and walk softly
away from her swain, declaring herself utterly insensible to
both his praises and his passion, and her resolution never
again to see or speak to him. This she did in admirable
style, though, perhaps, rather with the dignified gait and
sweeping majesty of tragedy-queen, than with any thing
like the pettish or sullen strut of a disdainful rustic; meanwhile
Strephon was supposed to be left inconsolable. Her
ladyship continued to support her assumed character for a
few yards, till a turn of the walk concealed her from Master
Richard; when, resuming her natural manner, she
turned back, with sparkling eyes, in order to ask his opinion
of her performances; and it was with some confusion,
and no little surprise, that on bursting again into his
sight, she discovered that Richard had not yet thrown off
his character. He was standing still, as she had left him,
fixed immovably upon the spot, in an attitude expressive
of sorrow for her departure, and bending forwards as if
imploring her return. It was the expression of his face
that astonished her most; for it was not at all an expression
appropriate to either his own character or to that
which he had assumed. It was an expression of earnest
and impassioned admiration; his whole soul seemed thrown
into his face, which was directed towards her, or rather
the place where she had disappeared; and his eyes were
projected in the same direction, with such a look as that
perhaps of an enraptured saint of old at the moment when
a divinity parted from his presence. This lasted, however,
but for a moment; for scarcely had that minute space of
time elapsed, before Richard, startled from his reverie by
Lady Jean’s sudden return, dismissed from his face all
trace of any extraordinary expression, and stood before
her (endeavouring to appear) just what he was, her ladyship’s
respectful servant and teacher. Nevertheless, this
transformation did not take place so quickly as to prevent
her ladyship from observing the present expression, nor
was it accomplished with such address as to leave her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
room for passing it over as unobserved. She was surprised—she
hesitated—she seemed, in spite of herself, conscious
of something awkward—and finally she blushed
slightly. Richard caught the contagion of her confusion
in a double degree; and Lady Jean, again, became more
confused on observing that he was aware of her confusion.
Richard was the first to recover himself and speak. He
made some remarks upon her singing and her acting—not,
however, upon her admirable performance of the latter
part of the drama; this encouraged her also to speak, and
both soon became somewhat composed. Shortly afterwards
they returned to the house; but from that moment
a chain of the most delicate yet indissoluble sympathies
began to connect the hearts of these youthful beings, so
alike in all natural qualities, and so dissimilar in every extraneous
thing which the world is accustomed to value.</p>

<p>After this interview there took place a slight estrangement
between Master Richard and Lady Jean, that lasted
a few days, during which they had much less of both conversation
and music than for some time before. Both
observed this circumstance; but each ascribed it to accident,
while it was in reality occasioned by mutual reserve.
Master Richard was afraid that Lady Jean might be offended
were he to propose any thing like a repetition of
the garden drama; and Lady Jean, on her part, could not,
consistently with the rules of maidenly modesty, utter even
a hint at such a thing, however she might secretly wish or
long for it. The very consciousness, reciprocally felt, of
having something on their minds, of which neither durst
speak, was sufficient to produce the said reserve, though
the emotions of “the tender passion” had not come in, as
they did, for a large share of the cause.</p>

<p>At length, however, this reserve was so far softened
down, that they began to resume their former practice of
walking together in the garden; but though the theorbo
continued to make one of the party, no more operatic performances
took place. Nevertheless, the mutual affection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
which had taken root in their hearts experienced on this
account no abatement, but, on the contrary, continued to
increase. As for Master Richard, it was no wonder that
he should be deeply smitten with the charms of his mistress;
for ever as he stole a long, furtive glance at her
graceful form, he thought he had never seen, in Spain or
in Italy, any such specimens of female loveliness; and (if
we may let the reader as far into the secret) he had indeed
come to Cumbernauld with the very purpose of falling in
love. Different causes had operated upon Lady Jean.
Richard being the first love-worthy object she had seen
since the period when the female heart becomes most susceptible—the
admiration with which she knew he beheld
her—his musical accomplishments, which had tended so
much to her gratification—all conspired to render him
precious in her sight. In the words of a beautiful modern
ballad, “all impulses of soul and sense had thrilled” her
gentle and guileless heart—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">——hopes, and fears that kindled hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">An undistinguishable throng,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gentle wishes, long subdued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Subdued and cherished long,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">had exercised their tender and delightful influence over
her; like a flower thrown upon one of the streams of her
own native land, whose course was through the beauties,
the splendours, and the terrors of nature, she was borne
away in a dream, the magic scenery of which was alternately
pleasing, fearful, and glorious, and from which she
could no more wake than could the flower restrain its course
on the gliding waters. The habit of contemplating her
lover every day, and that in the dignified character of an
instructor, gradually blinded her in a great measure to his
humbler quality, and to the probable sentiments of her
father and the world upon the subject of her passion. If
by any chance such a consideration was forced upon her
notice, and she found occasion to tremble lest the sentiments
in which she was so luxuriously indulging should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
end in disgrace and disaster, she soon quieted her fears,
by reverting to an idea which had lately occurred to her—namely,
that <em>Richard was not what he seemed</em>. She had
heard and read of love assuming strange disguises. A
Lord Belhaven, in the immediately preceding period of the
civil war, had taken refuge from the fury of Cromwell in
the service of an English nobleman, whose daughter’s
heart he won under the humble disguise of a gardener, and
whom, on the recurrence of better times, he carried home
to Scotland as his lady. This story was then quite popular,
and at least one of the parties still survived to attest its
truth. But even in nursery tales Lady Jean could find
examples which justified her own passion. The vilest
animals, she knew, on finding some beautiful dame, who
was so disinterested as to fall in love with them, usually
turned out to be the most beautiful princes that ever were
seen, and invariably married and made happy the ladies
whose affection had restored them to their natural form
and just inheritance. Who knows, she thought, but Richard
may some day, in a transport of passion, throw open his
coat, exhibit the star of nobility glittering on his breast, and
ask me to become a countess?</p>

<p>Such are the excuses which love suggests to reason, and
which the reason of lovers easily accepts; while those who
are neither youthful nor in love wonder at the hallucination
of their impassioned juniors. Experience soon teaches us
that this world is not one of romance, and that few incidents
in life ever occur out of the ordinary way. But before
we acquire this experience by actual observation, we
all of us regard things in a very different light. The
truth seems to be, that, in the eyes of youth, “the days
of chivalry” do not appear to be “gone;” our ideas are
then contemporary, or upon a par with the early romantic
ages of the world; and it is only by mingling with mature
men, and looking at things as they are, that we at length
advance towards, and ultimately settle down in, the <em>real
era</em> of our existence. Was there ever yet youth who did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
not feel some chivalrous impulses—some thirst for more
glorious scenes than those around him—some aspirations
after lofty passion and supreme excellence—or who did not
cherish some pure first-love, that could not prudentially
be gratified?</p>

<p>The greater part of the rest of the summer passed away
before the lovers came to an eclaircissement; and such,
indeed, was their mutual reserve upon the subject, that,
had it not been for the occurrence of a singular and deciding
circumstance, there appeared little probability of this
ever otherwise taking place. The Earl of Home, a gay
and somewhat foolish young nobleman, one morning after
attending a convivial party where the charms of Lady Jean
Fleming formed the principal topic of discourse, left Edinburgh
and took the way to Cumbernauld, on the very pilgrimage,
and with the very purpose which Lord Wigton
had before anticipated. Resolved first to see, then to
love, and lastly to run away with the young lady, his
lordship skulked about for a few days, and at last had the
pleasure of seeing the hidden beauty over the garden wall,
as she was walking with Master Richard. He thought he
had never seen any lady who could be at all compared to
Lady Jean, and, as a matter of course, resolved to make
her his own, and surprise all his companions at Edinburgh
with his success and her beauty. He watched
again next day, and happening to meet Master Richard
out of the bounds of <em>Cumbernauld policy</em>, accosted him,
with the intention of securing his services in making his
way towards Lady Jean. After a few words of course, he
proposed the subject to Richard, and offered a considerable
bribe, to induce him to work for his interest. Richard
at first rejected the offer, but immediately after, on bethinking
himself, saw fit to accept it. He was to mention
his lordship’s purpose to Lady Jean, and to prepare the
way for a private interview with her. On the afternoon
of the succeeding day, he was to meet Lord Home at the
same place, and tell him how Lady Jean had received his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
proposals. With this they parted—Richard to muse on
this unexpected circumstance, which he saw might blast
all his hopes unless he should resolve upon prompt and
active measures, and the Earl of Home to enjoy himself
at the humble inn of the village of Cumbernauld, where
he had for the last few days enacted the character of “the
daft lad frae Edinburch, that seemed to ha’e mair siller
than sense.”</p>

<p>On the morning of the tenth day after Master Richard’s
first interview with Lord Home, that faithful serving-man
found himself jogging swiftly along the road to Edinburgh,
mounted on a stout nag, with the fair Lady Jean seated
comfortably on a pillion behind him. It was a fine morning
in autumn, and the road had a peculiarly gay appearance
from the multitude of country-people, mounted and
dismounted, who seemed also hastening towards the capital.
Master Richard, upon inquiry, discovered that it was the
<em>market-day</em>, a circumstance which seemed favourable to his
design, by the additional assurance it gave him of not being
recognised among the extraordinary number of strangers
who might be expected to crowd the city on such an occasion.
The lovers approached the city by the west, and
the first street they entered was the suburban one called
Portsburgh, which leads towards the great market-place of
Edinburgh. Here Richard, impatient as he was, found
himself obliged, like many other rustic cavaliers, to reduce
the pace of his horse to a walk, on account of the narrowness
and crowded state of the street. This he felt the
more disagreeable, as it subjected him and his interesting
companion to the close and leisurely scrutiny of the inhabitants.
Both had endeavoured to disguise every thing
remarkable in their appearance, so far as dress and demeanour
could be disguised; yet, as Lady Jean could not
conceal her extraordinary beauty, and Richard had not
found it possible to part with a slight and dearly-beloved
moustache, it naturally followed that they were honoured
with a good deal of staring. Many an urchin upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
street threw up his arms as they passed along, exclaiming
“Oh! the black-bearded man!” or, “Oh! the bonnie
leddie!”—the men all admired Lady Jean, the women
Master Richard—and many an old shoemaker ogled them
earnestly over his half-door, with his spectacles pushed up
above his dingy cowl. The lovers, who had thus to run a
sort of gauntlet of admiration and remark, were glad when
they reached an inn, which Richard, who was slightly acquainted
with the town, knew to be a proper place for the
performance of a <em>half-merk marriage</em>. They alighted, and
were civilly received by an obsequious landlady, who conducted
them into an apartment at the back of the house.
There Lady Jean was for a short time left to make some
arrangements about her dress, while Richard disclosed to
the landlady in another room the purpose upon which he
was come to her house, and consulted her about procuring
a clergyman. The dame of the house, to whom a clandestine
marriage was the merest matter of course, showed the
utmost willingness to facilitate the design of her guests, and
said that she believed a clerical official might be procured
in a few minutes, provided that neither had any scruples of
conscience, as “most part of fouk frae the west had,” in
accepting the services of an Episcopal clergyman. The
lover assured her that, so far from having any objection to
“a government minister,” for so they were sometimes
termed, he would prefer such to any other, as both he
and his bride belonged to that persuasion. The landlady
heard this declaration with complacency, which showed
that she loved her guests the better for it; and told Richard
that, if he pleased, she would immediately introduce to
him the Dean of St Giles, who, honest man, was just
now taking his <em>meridian</em> in the little back garret parlour,
along with his friend and gossip, Bowed Andrew, the
waiter of the West Port. To this Richard joyfully assented,
and speedily he and Lady Jean were joined in their room
by the said dean, a squat little gentleman, with a drunken
but important-looking face, and an air of consequentiality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
even in his stagger, that was partly imposing and
partly ridiculous. He addressed his clients with a patronising
simper, of which the effect was grievously disconcerted
by an unlucky hiccup, and in a speech which might have
had the intended tone of paternal and reverend authority,
had it not been smattered and degraded into shreds by the
crapulous insufficiency of his tongue. Richard cut short
his ill-sustained attempts at dignity, by requesting him to
partake of some liquor. His reverence almost leaped at
the proffered jug, which contained ale. He first took a
tasting, then a sip—shaking his head between—next a
small draught, with a still more convulsion-like shake of
the head; and lastly, he took a hearty and persevering swill,
from the effects of which his lungs did not recover for at
least twenty respirations. The impatient lover then begged
him to proceed with the ceremony, which he forthwith
commenced in presence of the landlady and the above-mentioned
Bowed Andrew; and in a few minutes, Richard
and Lady Jean were united in the holy bands of matrimony.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was concluded, and both the clergyman
and the witnesses had been satisfied and dismissed,
the lovers left the house, with the design of walking forwards
into the city. In conformity to a previous arrangement,
Lady Jean walked first, like a lady of quality, and
Richard followed closely behind, with the dress and deportment
of her servant. Her ladyship was dressed in
her finest suit, and adorned with her finest jewels, all
which she had brought from Cumbernauld on purpose, in
a mail or leathern trunk—for such was the name then
given to the convenience now entitled a portmanteau.
Her step was light, and her bearing gay, as she moved
along—not on account of the success which had attended
her expedition, or her satisfaction in being now united to
the man of her choice, but because she anticipated the
highest pleasure in the sight of a place whereof she had
heard such wonderful stories, and from a participation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
whose delights she had been so long withheld. Like all
persons educated in the country, she had been regaled in
her infancy with magnificent descriptions of the capital—of
its buildings, that seemed to mingle with the clouds—its
shops, which apparently contained more wealth than
all the world beside—of its paved streets (for paved
streets were then wonders in Scotland)—and, above all, of
the grand folks who thronged its Highgates, its Canongates,
and its Cowgates—people whose lives seemed a
perpetual holiday, whose attire was ever new, and who
all lived in their several palaces. Though, of course,
Edinburgh had then little to boast of, the country people
who occasionally visited it did not regard it with less
admiration than that with which the peasantry of our
own day may be supposed to view it now that it is something
so very different. It was then, as well as now,
the capital of the country, and, as such, bore the same
disproportion in point of magnificence to inferior towns,
and to the country in general. In one respect, it was
superior to what it is at the present day—namely, in
being the seat of government and of a court. Lady Jean
had often heard all its glorious peculiarities described by
her sisters, who, moreover, sometimes took occasion to
colour the picture too highly, in order to raise her envy,
and make themselves appear great in their alliance and
association with so much greatness. She was, therefore,
prepared to see a scene of the utmost splendour—a
scene in which nothing horrible or paltry mingled, but
which was altogether calculated to awe or to delight the
senses.</p>

<p>Her ladyship was destined to be disappointed at the
commencement, at least, of her acquaintance with the
city. The first remarkable object which struck her eye,
after leaving the inn, was the high <em>bow</em>, or arch, of the
gate called the West Port. In this itself there was nothing
worthy of particular attention, and she rather directed
her eyes through the opening beneath, which half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
disclosed a wide space beyond, apparently crowded with
people. But when she came close up to the gate, and
cast, before passing, a last glance at the arch, she shuddered
at the sight then presented to her eyes. On the
very pinnacle of the arch were stuck the ghastly and weatherworn
remains of a human head, the features of which,
half flesh half bone, were shaded, and rendered still more
indistinctly horrible by the long dark hair, which hung in
meagre tresses around them. “Oh, Richard, Richard!”
she exclaimed, stopping, and turning round, “what is that
dreadful looking thing?” “That, madam,” said Richard,
without any emotion, “is the broken remnant of a west
country preacher, spiked up there to warn his countrymen
who may approach this port, against doing any thing to
incur the fate which has overtaken himself. Methinks he
has preached to small purpose, for yonder stands the gallows,
ready, I suppose, to bring him some brother in affliction.”
“Horrible!” exclaimed Lady Jean; “and is
this really the fine town of Edinburgh, where I was taught
to expect so many grand sights? I thought it was just one
universal palace, and it turns out to be a great charnel-house!”
“It is indeed more like that than any thing else
at times,” said Richard; “but, my dear Lady Jean, you
are not going to start at this bugbear, which the very children,
you see, do not heed in passing.” “Indeed I think,
Richard,” answered her ladyship, “if Edinburgh is to be
all like this, it would be just as good to turn back at once,
and postpone our visit till better times.” “But it is not
all like this,” replied Richard; “I assure you it is not. For
heaven’s sake, my lady, move on. The people are beginning
to stare at us. You shall soon see grand sights
enough, if we were once fairly out of this place. Make
for the opposite corner of the Grassmarket, and ascend the
street to the left of that horrible gibbet. We may yet get
past it before the criminals are produced.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Lady Jean passed, not without a
shudder, under the dreadful arch, and entered the spacious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
oblong square called the Grassmarket. This place was
crowded at the west end with rustics engaged in all the
bustle of a grain and cattle market, and at the eastern
and most distant extremity with a mob of idlers who had
gathered around the gibbet, in order to witness the awful
ceremony that was about to take place. The crowd,
which was scarcely so dense as that which attends the
rarer scene of a modern execution, made way on both
sides for Lady Jean as she moved along; and wherever
she went, she left behind her a <em>wake</em>, as it were, of admiration
and confusion. So exquisite and so new a beauty,
so splendid a suit of female attire, and such a stout and
handsome attendant—these were all alike calculated to
inspire reverence in the minds of the beholders. Her
carriage at the same time was so steady and so graceful,
that no one could be so rude as to interrupt or disturb it.
The people, therefore, parted when she approached, and
left a free passage for her on all sides, as if she had been
an angel or a spirit come to walk amidst a mortal crowd,
and whose person could not be touched, and might scarcely
be beheld—whose motions were not to be interfered with
by those among whom she chose to walk—but who was
to be received with prostration of spirit, and permitted to
depart as she had come, unquestioned and unapproached.
In traversing the Grassmarket, two or three young coxcombs,
with voluminous wigs, short cloaks, rapiers, and
rose-knots at their knees and shoes, who, on observing
her at a distance, had prepared to treat her with a condescending
stare, fell back, awed and confounded, at her
near approach, and spent the gaze, perhaps, upon the
humbler mark of her follower, or upon vacancy.</p>

<p>Having at length passed the gibbet, Lady Jean began
to ascend the steep and tortuous street denominated the
West Bow. She had hitherto been unable to direct any
attention to what she was most anxious to behold—the
scenic wonders of the capital. But having now got clear
of the crowd, and no longer fearing to see the gallows, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
ventured to lift up her eyes and look around. The tallness
and massiveness of the buildings, some of which bore
the cross of the Knights Templars on their pinnacles, while
others seemed to be surmounted or overtopped by still
taller edifices beyond, impressed her imagination; and the
effect was rendered still more striking by the countless
human figures which crowded the windows, and even the
roofs of the houses, all alike bending their attention, as she
thought, towards herself. The scene before her looked
like an amphitheatre filled with spectators, while she and
Richard seemed as the objects upon the arena. The
thought caused her to hurry on, and she soon found herself
in a great measure screened from observation by the
overhanging projections of the narrower part of the West
Bow, which she now entered. With slow and difficult,
but stately and graceful steps, she then proceeded, till she
reached the upper angle of the street, where a novel and
unexpected scene awaited her. A sound like that of rushing
waters seemed first to proceed from the part of the
street still concealed from her view, and presently appeared
round the angle the first rank of an impetuous
crowd, who, rushing downward with prodigious force,
would certainly have overwhelmed her delicate form, had
she not dexterously avoided them, by stepping aside upon a
projecting stair, to which Richard also sprung, just in time to
save himself from a similar fate. From this place of safety,
which was not without its own crowd of children, women,
and sage-looking elderly mechanics, with Kilmarnock cowls,
both in the next moment saw the massive mob rush past,
like the first wave of a flood, bearing either <em>along</em> or <em>down</em>
every thing that came in their way. Immediately after,
but at a more deliberate pace, followed a procession of
figures, which struck the heart of Lady Jean with as heavy
a sense of sorrow as the crowd had just impressed with
terror and surprise. First came a small company of the
veterans of the city-guard, some of whom had perhaps
figured in the campaigns of Middleton and Montrose, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
whose bronzed inflexible faces bore on this melancholy occasion
precisely the same expression which they ordinarily
exhibited on the joyful one of attending the magistrates
at the drinking of the king’s health on the 29th of May.
Behind these, and encircled by some other soldiers of the
same band, appeared two figures of a different sort. One
of them was a young-looking, but pale and woe-worn man,
the impressive wretchedness of whose appearance was
strikingly increased by the ghastly dress which he wore.
He was attired from head to foot in a white shroud, such
as was sometimes worn in Scotland by criminals at the gallows,
but which was, in the present instance, partly assumed
as a badge of innocence. The excessive whiteness
and emaciation of his countenance suited well with this
dismal apparel, and, with the wild enthusiasm that kindled
in his eyes, gave an almost supernatural effect to the whole
scene, which rather resembled a pageant of the dead than
a procession of earthly men. He was the only criminal;
the person who walked by his side, and occasionally supported
his steps, being—as the crowd whispered around,
with many a varied expression of sympathy—his father.
The old man had the air of a devout Presbyterian, with
harsh, intelligent features, and a dress which bespoke his
being a countryman of the lower rank. According to the
report of the bystanders, he had educated this his only
son for the unfortunate Church of Scotland, and now attended
him to the fate which his talents and violent temperament
had conspired to draw down upon his head. If
he ever felt any pride in the popular admiration with which
his son was honoured, no traces of such a sentiment now
appeared. On the contrary, he seemed humbled to the
very earth with sorrow; and though he had perhaps contemplated
the issue now about to take place, with no small
portion of satisfaction, so long as it was at a distance and
uncertain, the feelings of a father had evidently proved too
much for his fortitude when the event approached in all
its dreadful reality. The emotions perceptible in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
rough and rigid countenance were the more striking, as
being so much at variance with its natural and characteristic
expression; and the tear which gathered in his eye
excited the greater commiseration, in so far as it seemed a
stranger there. But the hero and heroine of our tale had
little time to make observations on this piteous scene, for
the train passed quickly on, and was soon beyond their
sight. When it was gone, the people of the Bow, who
seemed accustomed to such sights, uttered various expressions
of pity, indignation, and horror, according to their
respective feelings, and then slowly retired to their dens in
the stairs and booths which lined the whole of this ancient
and singular street.</p>

<p>Lady Jean, whose beautiful eyes were suffused with
tears at beholding so melancholy a spectacle, was then admonished
by her attendant to proceed. With a heart
hardened to all sensations of wonder and delight, she
moved forward, and was soon ushered into the place called
the Lawnmarket, then perhaps the most fashionable district
in Edinburgh, but the grandeur and spaciousness of
which she beheld almost without admiration. The scene
here was however much gayer, and approached more nearly
to her splendid preconceptions of the capital than any she
had yet seen. The shops were, in her estimation, very
fine, and some of the people on the street were of that
noble description of which she had believed all inhabitants
of cities to be. There was no crowd on the street, which,
therefore, afforded room for a better display of her stately
and beautiful person; and as she walked steadily onwards,
still <em>ushed</em> (for such was then the phrase) by her handsome
and noble-looking attendant, a greater degree of admiration
was excited amongst the gay idlers whom she
passed, than even that which marked her progress through
the humbler crowd of the Grassmarket. Various noblemen,
in passing towards their homes in the Castle Hill,
lifted their feathered hats and bowed profoundly to the
lovely vision; and one or two magnificent dames, sweeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
along with their long silk trains, borne up by livery-men,
stared at or eyed askance the charms which threw
their own so completely into shade. By the time Lady
Jean arrived at the bottom of the Lawnmarket, that is to
say, where it was partially closed up by the Tolbooth,
she had in a great measure recovered her spirits, and found
herself prepared to enjoy the sight of the public buildings,
which were so thickly clustered together at this central
part of the city. She was directed by Richard to pass
along the narrow road which then led between the houses
and the Tolbooth on the south, and which, being continued
by a still narrower passage skirting the west end
of St Giles’s church, formed the western approach to the
Parliament Close. Obeying his guidance in this tortuous
passage, she soon found herself at the opening or the square
space, so styled on account of its being closed on more
than one side by the meeting-place of the legislative assembly
of Scotland. Here a splendid scene awaited her.
The whole square was filled with the members of the
Scottish Parliament, barons and commons, who had just
left the house in which they sat together—with ladies,
who on days of unusual ceremony were allowed to attend
the house—and with horses richly caparisoned, and covered
with gold-embroidered foot-cloths, some of which
were mounted by their owners, while others were held in
readiness by footmen. All was bustle and magnificence.
Noblemen and gentlemen in splendid attire threaded the
crowd in search of their horses; ladies tripped after them
with timid and careful steps, endeavouring, by all in their
power, to avoid contact with such objects as were calculated
to injure their fineries; grooms strode heavily about, and
more nimble lacqueys jumped every where, here and there,
some of them as drunk as the Parliament Close claret could
make them, but all intent on doing the duties of attendance
and respect to their masters. Some smart and well-dressed
young gentlemen were arranging their cloaks and swords,
and preparing to leave the square on foot by the passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
which had given entry to Master Richard and Lady
Jean.</p>

<p>At sight of our heroine, most of these gallants stood still
in admiration, and one of them, with the trained assurance
of a rake, observing her to be beautiful, a stranger, and not
too well protected, accosted her in a strain of language
which caused her at once to blush and tremble. Richard’s
brow reddened with anger, as he hesitated not a moment
in stepping up and telling the offender to leave the lady
alone, on pain of certain consequences which might not
prove agreeable. “And who are you, my brave fellow?”
said the youth, with bold assurance. “Sirrah!” exclaimed
Richard, so indignant as to forget himself, “I am that lady’s
husband—her servant, I mean;” and here he stopped short
in some confusion. “Admirable!” exclaimed the other.
“Ha! ha! ha! ha! Here, Sirs, is a lady lacquey, who
does not know whether he is his mistress’s servant or her
husband. Let us give him up to the town-guard to see
whether the black-hole will make him remember the real
state of the case.” So saying, he attempted to push Richard
aside, and take hold of the lady. But he had not time to
touch her garments with so much as a finger, before her
protector had a rapier flourishing in his eyes, and threatened
him with instant death, unless he desisted from his
profane purpose. At sight of the bright steel, he stepped
back one or two paces, drew his own sword, and was preparing
to fight, when one of his more grave associates called
out, “For shame, Rollo!—with a lady’s lacquey, too, and
in the presence of the duke and duchess! I see their royal
highnesses, already alarmed, are inquiring the cause of the
disturbance.” It was even as this gentleman said, and
presently came up to the scene of contention some of the
most distinguished personages in the crowd, one of whom
demanded from the parties an explanation of so disgraceful
an occurrence. “Why, here is a fellow, my lord,” answered
Rollo, “who says he is the husband of a lady
whom he attends as a livery-man, and a lady, too, the bonniest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
I dare say, that has been seen in Scotland since the
days of Queen Magdalen!” “And what matters it to
you,” said the inquirer, who seemed to be a Judge of the
Session, “in what relation this man stands to his lady?
Let the parties both come forward, and tell their ain tale.
May it please your royal highness,” he continued, addressing
a very grave dignitary who sat on horseback behind
him, as stiff and formal as a sign-post, “to hear the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">declaratur</i>
of thir twa strange incomers. But see—see—what is
the matter with Lord Wigton?” he added, pointing to an
aged personage on horseback, who had just pushed forward,
and seemed about to faint, and fall from his horse. The
person alluded to, at sight of his daughter in this unexpected
place, was in reality confounded, and it was some
time before he mastered voice enough to ejaculate, “O,
Jean, Jean! what’s this ye’ve been about? or what has
brocht you to Edinburgh?” “And Lord have a care o’ us!”
exclaimed at this juncture another venerable peer, who had
just come up, “what has brocht my sonsie son, Ritchie
Livingstone, to Edinburgh, when he should have been
fechtin’ the Dutch by this time in Pennsylvania?” The
two lovers, thus recognised by their respective parents,
stood with downcast looks, and perfectly silent, while all
was buzz and confusion in the brilliant circle around them;
for the parties concerned were not more surprised at the
aspect of their affairs, than were all the rest at the beauty
of the far-famed but hitherto unseen Lady Jean Fleming.
The Earl of Linlithgow, Richard’s father, was the first to
speak aloud, after the general astonishment had for some
time subsided; and this he did in a laconic though important
query, which he couched in the simple words, “Are
you married, bairns?” “Yes, dearest father,” said his son,
gathering courage, and coming close up to his saddle-bow;
“and I beseech you to extricate Lady Jean and me from
this crowd, and I shall tell you all when we are alone.”
“A pretty man ye are, truly,” said the old man, who never
took any thing very seriously to heart, “to be staying at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
hame, and getting yourself married, all the time you should
have been abroad, winning honour and wealth, as your
gallant grand-uncle did wi’ Gustavus i’ the thretties! Hooever,
since better mayna be, I maun try and console my
Lord Wigton, who, I doot, has the worst o’ the bargain,
ye ne’er-do-weel!” He then went up to Lady Jean’s father,
shook him by the hand, and said, “that though they
had been made relations against their wills, he hoped they
would continue good friends. The young people,” he observed,
“are no that ill matched; and it is not the first
time that the Flemings and the Livingstones have melled
together, as witness the blithe marriage of the Queen’s
Marie to Lord Fleming, in the feifteen saxty-five. At any
rate, my lord, let us put a good face on the matter, afore
they glowering gentles and whipper-snapper duchesses. I’ll
get horses for the two, and they’ll join the ridin’ down the
street; and deil hae me if Lady Jean disna outshine them,
the hale o’ them!” “My Lord Linlithgow,” responded
the graver and more implacable Earl of Wigton, “it may
set you to take this matter blithely; but, let me tell you,
it’s a muckle mair serious affair for me. What think ye
am I to do wi’ Kate and Grizzy noo?” “Hoot, toot, my
lord,” said Linlithgow, with a sly smile, “their chance is
as gude as ever it was, I assure you, and sae will every body
think that kens them. I <em>maun</em> ca’ horses though, or the
young folk will be ridden ower, afore ever they do mair
gude, by thae rampaugin’ young men.” So saying, and
taking Lord Wigton’s moody silence for assent, he proceeded
to cry to his servants for the best pair of horses
they could get; and these being speedily procured, Lord
Richard and his bride were requested to mount; after
which, they were formally introduced to the gracious notice
of the Duke and Duchess of York, and the Princess Anne,
who happened to attend Parliament on this the last day of
its session, when it was customary for all the members to
ride both to and from the house in an orderly cavalcade.
The order was now given to proceed, and the lovers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
soon relieved, in a great measure, from the embarrassing
notice of the crowd, by assuming a particular place in the
procession, and finding themselves confounded with more
than three hundred equally splendid figures. As the pageant,
however, moved down the High Street, in a continuous
and open line, it was impossible not to distinguish the
singular loveliness of Lady Jean, and the gallant carriage
of her husband, from all the rest. Accordingly, the very
trained bands and city-guard, who lined the street, and
who were, in general, quite as insensible to the splendours
of <em>the Riding</em>, as are the musicians in a modern orchestra
to the wonders of a melo-drama in its fortieth night—even
<em>they</em> perceived and admired the graces of the young couple,
whom they could not help gazing after with a stupid and
lingering delight. From the windows, too, and the <em>stair-heads</em>,
their beauty was well observed, and amply conjectured
and commented on; while many a young cavalier
endeavoured, by all sorts of pretences, to find occasion to
break the order of the cavalcade, and get himself haply
placed nearer to the exquisite figure of which he had got
just one killing glance in the square. Slowly and majestically
the brilliant train paced down the great street of Edinburgh,
the acclamations of the multitude ceaselessly expressing
the delight which the people of Scotland felt in
this sensible type and emblem of their ancient independence.
At length they reached the court-yard of Holyrood-house,
where the duke and duchess invited the
whole assemblage to a ball, which they designed to give
that evening in the hall of the palace; after which, all departed
to their respective residences throughout the town,
Lords Wigton and Linlithgow taking their young friends
under their immediate protection, and seeking the residence
of the former nobleman, a little way up the Canongate.
In riding thither, the lovers had leisure to explain to their
parents the singular circumstances of their union, and address
enough to obtain unqualified forgiveness for their imprudence.
On alighting at Lord Wigton’s house, Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Jean found her sisters confined to their rooms with headaches,
or some such serious indisposition, and in the utmost
dejection on account of having been thereby withheld from
the riding of the Parliament. Their spirits, as may be supposed,
were not much elevated, when, on coming forth in
dishabille to welcome their sister, they found she had had
the good fortune to be married before them. Their ill
luck was, however, irremediable; and so, making a merit
of submitting to it, they condescended to be rather agreeable
during the dinner and the afternoon. It was not long
before all parties were perfectly reconciled to what had
taken place; and by the time it was necessary to dress for
the ball, the elder young ladies declared themselves so
much recovered as to be able to accompany their happy
sister. The Earl of Linlithgow and his son then sent a
servant for proper dresses, and prepared themselves for the
occasion without leaving the house. When all were ready,
a number of chairs were called to transport their dainty
persons down the street. The news of Lady Jean’s arrival,
and of her marriage, having now spread abroad, the
court in front of the house, the alley, and even the open
street, were crowded with people of all ranks, anxious to
catch a passing glimpse of the heroine of so strange a tale.
As her chair was carried along, a buzz of admiration from
all who were so happy as to be near it, marked its progress.
Happy, too, was the gentleman who had the good
luck to be near her chair as it was set down at the palace
gate, and assist her in stepping from it upon the lighted
pavement. From the outer gate, along the piazza of the
inner court, and all the way up the broad staircase to the
illuminated hall, two rows of noblemen and gentlemen
formed a brilliant avenue as she passed along, while a
hundred plumed caps were doffed in honour of so much
beauty, and as many youthful eyes glanced bright with satisfaction
at beholding it. The object of all this attention
tripped modestly along in the hand of the Earl of Linlithgow,
acknowledging, with many a graceful flexure and undulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of person, the compliments of the spectators. At
length the company entered the spacious and splendid room
in which the ball was to be held. At the extremity opposite
to the entry, upon an elevated platform, sat the three
royal personages, all of whom, on Lady Jean’s introduction,
rose and came forward to welcome her and her husband
to the entertainments of Holyrood, and to hope that
her ladyship would often adorn their circle. In a short
time the dancing commenced; and amidst all the ladies
who exhibited their charms and their magnificent attire in
that captivating exercise, who was, either in person or
dress, half so brilliant as Lady Jean?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FALLACIES_OF_THE_YOUNG">FALLACIES OF THE YOUNG.<br>
<span class="fs80">“FATHERS HAVE FLINTY HEARTS.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I only quote this popular expression from a very popular
play, in order to warn my juvenile friends against being too
much impressed by it. It is a fatal error running through
nearly the whole mass of our fictitious literature, that parents
are represented as invariably adverse, through their
own cruel and selfish views, to the inclinations of their children:
either the glowing ambition and high spirit of the
boy is repressed by the cold calculations of his father, who
wishes him to become a mere creature of the counting-room
and shop like himself; or the romantic attachment of the
girl to some elegant Orlando, procures her a confinement
to her chamber, with no other alternative than that of
marrying a detestable suitor, whom her father prefers to
all others on account of his wealth. Then, the boy always
runs away from his father’s house, and, by following
his own inclinations, acquires fortune and fame; while the
girl as invariably leaps a three-pair-of-stairs window, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
is happy for life with the man of her choice. The same
dangerous system pervades the stage, where, I am sorry to
remark, every vicious habit of society, and every impropriety
in manners and speech, is always sure to be latest
abandoned.</p>

<p>I warn my juvenile readers most emphatically against
the fallacy and delusion which prevails upon this subject.
Fathers, as a class, have not flinty hearts, nor is it their
wish or interest, in general, to impose a cruel restraint
upon their children. Young people would do well to examine
the circumstances in which they stand in regard to
their parents and guardians, before believing in the reality
of that schism which popular literature would represent as
invariably existing between their own class and that of
their natural protectors. The greater part, I am sure, of
my young friends, must have observed, that, so long as they
can remember, they have been indebted for every comfort,
and for a thousand acts of kindness and marks of affection,
to those endeared beings—<em>their father and mother</em>. The
very dawning light of existence must have found them in
the enjoyment of many blessings procured to them solely
by those two individuals. From them must have been derived
the food they ate, the bed they lay on, the learning
at school which enabled their minds to appreciate all the
transactions and all the wisdom of past times, and, greatest
blessing of all, the habits of devotional exercise which admitted
them to commune with their almighty Creator.
Surely it is not to be supposed that, at a certain time, the
kindness and friendship of these two amiable persons is all
at once converted into a malignant contrariety to the interests
of their children. Is it not far more likely, my dear
young friends, that they continue, as ever, to be your well-wishers
and benefactors: and that the opposition which
they seem to set up so ungraciously against your inclinations,
is only caused by their sense of the dangers which
threaten you in the event of your being indulged? It may
appear to you that no such danger exists: that your parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
are actuated by narrower and meaner views than your
own, or that they do not allow for the feelings of youth.
But they are in reality deeply concerned for the difference
of <em>your</em> feelings from <em>theirs</em>; they sympathise with them in
secret, from a recollection of what were their own at your
period of life; but know, from that very experience of your
feelings, and of their result, that it is not good for you that
they should be indulged. You are, then, called upon—and
I do so now in the name of your best feelings, and as
you would wish for present or future happiness—to trust
in the reality of that parental tenderness which has never,
heretofore, known interruption, and in the superiority of
that wisdom with which years and acquaintance with the
world have invested your parents.</p>

<p>Perhaps, my young friends, you may have perceived,
even in the midst of your childish frolics and careless happiness,
that your parents were obliged to deny themselves
many indulgences, and toil hard in their respective duties,
in order to obtain for you the comforts which you enjoy.
You may have perceived that your father, after he had returned
home from his daily employment, could hardly be
prevailed upon to enter, as you wished, into your sports,
or to assist you with your lessons, but would sit, in silent
and abstracted reflection, with a deep shade of care upon
his brow. On these occasions, perhaps, your amiable and
kind protector is considering how difficult it is, even with
all his industry, and all his denial of indulgences to himself,
to procure for you an exemption from that wretchedness in
which you see thousands of other children every day involved.
But though many are the cares which your parents
experience, in the duty of rearing you to manhood,
there is none so severe or so acute as that which comes
upon them at the period of your entering into life. Heretofore,
you were simple little children, with hardly a thought
beyond the family scene in which you have enjoyed so many
comforts. Heretofore, with the exception of occasional
rebukes from your parents, and trifling quarrels with your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
brothers and sisters, you have all been one family of love,
eating at the same board, kneeling in one common prayer,
loving one another, as the dearest of all friends. But now
the scene becomes very different. You begin to feel, within
yourselves, separate interests, and each thinks himself best
qualified to judge for himself. At that moment, my young
friends, the anxiety of your parents is a thousand times
greater than it ever was before. Your father, probably, is
a man of formed habits and character; he occupies a certain
respectable station in the world; he has all his life been
governed by certain principles, which he found to be conducive
to his comfort and dignity. But though he has
been able to conduct himself through the world in this satisfactory
manner, he is sensible, from the various and
perhaps altogether opposite characters which nature has
implanted in you, that you may go far wide of what have
been his favourite objects, and perhaps be the means of
impairing that respectability which he, as a single individual,
has hitherto maintained. It is often observed in life,
that children who have been reared by poor but virtuous
parents, as if their minds had received in youth a horror
for every attribute of poverty, exert themselves with such
vigorous and consistent fortitude, as to end with fortune
and dignity; while the children, perhaps, of these individuals,
being brought up without the same acquaintance
with want and hardship, are slothful through life, and soon
bring back the family to its original condition. If you then
have been reared in easy circumstances, you may believe
what I now tell you, that your approach to manhood or
womanhood will produce a degree of anxiety in the breasts
of your parents, such as would, if you knew it, make your
very heart bleed for their distress, and cause you to appear
as monsters to yourselves if you were to act in any great
degree differently from what they wished.</p>

<p>How much, then, is it your duty, my young friends, to
treat the advices and wishes of your parents, at this period
of life, with respect, knowing, as you do, that the future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
happiness of those dear and kind beings depends almost
solely upon your conducting yourselves properly in your
first steps into life! Should you be so unfortunate as to be
beguiled into bad company, or to contract a disposition to
indulgences which are the very bane of existence, and the
ruin of reputation, what must be the agony of those individuals
who have hitherto loved and cherished you, and
indulged, perhaps, in very different anticipations! On the
contrary, should you yield respect, as far as it is in your
nature, to the maxims which your father has endeavoured
to impress, with what delight does he look forward to your
future success—with what happy confidence does he rely
upon your virtuous principles! And may there be no happiness
to <em>you</em>, in contemplating the happiness which you
have given to <em>him</em>? Yes, much, I am sure, and of a purer
kind than almost any which earthly things can confer upon
you here below.</p>

<p>I have one word to add, and it is addressed to the female
part of my juvenile readers. Exactly as parents feel a concern
for the first appearance of their sons in the business
of life, so do they experience many anxious and fearful
thoughts respecting the disposal of their daughters in matrimony.
Wedded life, I may inform them, is not the simple
matter which it appears prospectively in early and single
life. As it involves many serious duties and responsibilities,
it must be entered upon with a due regard to the means—above
all things, the pecuniary means—of discharging these
in a style of respectability, such as may be sufficient to support
the dignity of the various connexions of the parties.
It is, therefore, necessary that no person of tender years
(this is most frequently the lot of the female) should contract
the obligations of matrimony, without, if possible, the
entire sanction of parents or other protectors. The people
of this country happen to entertain, upon this subject, notions
of not so strict a kind as are prevalent in most other
nations. In almost all continental and all eastern countries,
the female is reared by her friends as the destined bride of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
a particular individual, and till her marriage she is allowed
no opportunity of bestowing her affections upon any other.
The custom is so ancient and so invariable, that it is submitted
to without any feeling of hardship; and as prudence
is the governing principle of the relations, the matches are
generally as happy as if they were more free. Perhaps such
a custom is inapplicable to this country, on account of our
different system of domestic life; but I may instance it, to
prove to my fair young readers, that the control of parents
over their choice of a husband ought to be looked upon as
a more tolerable and advantageous thing, than their inclinations
might be disposed to allow, or our popular literature
represents it to be.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="BRUNTFIELD">BRUNTFIELD,<br>
<span class="fs80">A TALE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The war carried on in Scotland, by the friends and enemies
of Queen Mary, after her departure into England, was
productive of an almost complete dissolution of order, and
laid the foundation of many feuds which were kept up by
private families and individuals long after all political cause
of hostility had ceased. Among the most remarkable quarrels
which history or tradition has recorded as arising out
of that civil broil, I know of none so deeply cherished, or
accompanied by so many romantic and peculiar circumstances,
as one which took place between two old families
of gentry in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Stephen
Bruntfield, laird of Craighouse, had been a zealous and disinterested
partisan of the queen. Robert Moubray of Barnbougle
was the friend successively of Murray and Morton,
and distinguished himself very highly in their cause. During
the year 1572, when Edinburgh castle was maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
by Kirkaldy of Grange in behalf of the queen, Stephen
Bruntfield held out Craighouse in the same interest, and
suffered a siege from a detachment of the forces of the regent,
commanded by the laird of Barnbougle. This latter
baron, a man of fierce and brutal nature, entered life as a
younger brother, and at an early period chose to cast his
fate among the Protestant leaders, with a view of improving
his fortunes. The death of his elder brother in rebellion
at Langside, enabled the Regent Murray to reward his
services with a grant of the patrimonial estate, of which he
did not scruple to take possession by the strong hand, to
the exclusion of his infant niece, the daughter of the late
proprietor. Some incidents which occurred in the course
of the war had inspired a mutual hatred of the most intense
character into the breasts of Bruntfield and Moubray; and
it was therefore with a feeling of strong personal animosity,
as well as of political rancour, that the latter undertook the
task of watching the motions of Bruntfield at Craighouse.
Bruntfield, after holding out for many months, was obliged,
along with his friends in Edinburgh castle, to yield to the
party of the regent. Like Kirkaldy and Maitland of Lethington,
he surrendered upon a promise of life and estate; but
while his two friends perished, one by the hand of the executioner,
the other by his own hand, he fell a victim to
the sateless spite of his personal enemy, who, in conducting
him to Edinburgh as a prisoner, took fire at some bitter
expression on the part of the captive, and smote him dead
upon the spot.</p>

<p>Bruntfield left a widow and three infant sons. The lady
of Craighouse had been an intimate of the unfortunate Mary
from her early years; was educated with her in France, in
the Catholic faith; and had left her court to become the
wife of Bruntfield. It was a time calculated to change the
natures of women, as well as of men. The severity with
which her religion was treated in Scotland, the wrongs of
her royal mistress, and finally the sufferings and death of
her husband, acting upon a mind naturally enthusiastic, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
conspired to alter the character of Marie Carmichael, and
substitute for the rosy hues of her early years, the gloom
of the sepulchre and the penitentiary. She continued, after
the restoration of peace, to reside in the house of her
late husband; but though it was within two miles of the
city, she did not for many years re-appear in public. With
no society but that of her children, and the persons necessary
to attend upon them, she mourned in secret over past
events, seldom stirring from a particular apartment, which,
in accordance with a fashion by no means uncommon, she
had caused to be hung with black, and which was solely
illuminated by a lamp. In the most rigorous observances
of her faith, she was assisted by a priest, whose occasional
visits formed almost the only intercourse which she maintained
with the external world. One strong passion gradually
acquired a complete sway over her mind—<span class="smcap">Revenge</span>—a
passion which the practice of the age had invested with
a conventional respectability, and which no kind of religious
feeling, then known, was able either to check or soften. So
entirely was she absorbed by this fatal passion, that her
very children, at length, ceased to have interest or merit
in her eyes, except in so far as they appeared likely to be
the means of gratifying it. One after another, as they
reached the age of fourteen, she sent them to France, in
order to be educated; but the accomplishment to which
they were enjoined to direct their principal attention was
that of martial exercises. The eldest, Stephen, returned,
at eighteen, a strong and active youth, with a mind of little
polish or literary information, but considered a perfect
adept at sword-play. As his mother surveyed his noble
form, a smile stole into the desert of her wan and widowed
face, as a winter sunbeam wanders over a waste of snows.
But it was a smile of more than motherly pride: she was
estimating the power which that frame would have in contending
with the murderous Moubray. She was not alone
pleased with the handsome figure of her first-born child;
but she thought with a fiercer and faster joy upon the appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
which it would make in the single combat against
the slayer of his father. Young Bruntfield, who, having
been from his earliest years trained to the purpose now
contemplated by his mother, rejoiced in the prospect,
now lost no time in preferring before the king a charge of
murder against the laird of Barnbougle, whom he at the
same time challenged, according to a custom then not altogether
abrogated, to prove his innocence in single combat.
The king having granted the necessary licence, the fight
took place in the royal park, near the palace; and, to the
surprise of all assembled, young Bruntfield fell under the
powerful sword of his adversary. The intelligence was
communicated to his mother at Craighouse, where she was
found in her darkened chamber, prostrate before an image
of the Virgin. The priest who had been commissioned to
break the news, opened his discourse in a tone intended to
prepare her for the worst; but she cut him short at the
very beginning with a frantic exclamation—“I know what
you would tell—the murderer’s sword has prevailed, and
there are now but two instead of three, to redress their
father’s wrongs!” The melancholy incident, after the first
burst of feeling, seemed only to have concentrated and increased
that passion by which she had been engrossed for
so many years. She appeared to feel that the death of her
eldest son only formed an addition to that debt which it
was the sole object of her existence to see discharged.
“Roger,” she said, “will have the death of his brother,
as well as that of his father, to avenge. Animated by such
a double object, his arm can hardly fail to be successful.”</p>

<p>Roger returned about two years after, a still handsomer,
more athletic, and more accomplished youth than his brother.
Instead of being daunted by the fate of Stephen, he
burned but the more eagerly to wipe out the injuries of his
house with the blood of Moubray. On his application for
a licence being presented to the court, it was objected by
the crown lawyers, that the case had been already closed
by <em>mal fortune</em> of the former challenger. But while this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
was the subject of their deliberation, the applicant caused
so much annoyance and fear in the court circle, by the
threats which he gave out against the enemy of his house,
that the king, whose inability to procure respect either for
himself or for the law is well known, thought it best to decide
in favour of his claim. Roger Bruntfield, therefore,
was permitted to fight in barras with Moubray; but the
same fortune attended him as that which had already deprived
the widow of her first child. Slipping his foot in
the midst of the combat, he reeled to the ground, embarrassed
by his cumbrous armour. Moubray, according to
the barbarous practice of the age, immediately sprang upon
and despatched him. “Heaven’s will be done!” said the
widow, when she heard of the fatal incident; “but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratias
Deo!</i> there still remains another chance.”</p>

<p>Henry Bruntfield, the third and last surviving son, had
all along been the favourite of his mother. Though apparently
cast in a softer mould than his two elder brothers,
and bearing all the marks of a gentler and more amiable
disposition, he in reality cherished the hope of avenging
his father’s death more deeply in the recesses of his heart,
and longed more ardently to accomplish that deed than any
of his brothers. His mind, naturally susceptible of the softest
and tenderest impressions, had contracted the enthusiasm
of his mother’s wish in its strongest shape; as the
fairest garments are capable of the deepest stain. The intelligence,
which reached him in France, of the death of
his brothers, instead of bringing to his heart the alarm and
horror which might have been expected, only braced him
to the adventure which he now knew to be before him.
From this period, he forsook the elegant learning which he
had heretofore delighted to cultivate. His nights were
spent in poring over the memoirs of distinguished knights—his
days were consumed in the tilt-yard of the sword-player.
In due time he entered the French army, in order to add
to mere science that practical hardihood, the want of which
he conceived to be the cause of the death of his brothers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Though the sun of chivalry was now declining far in the
occident, it was not yet altogether set: Montmorency was
but just dead; Bayard was still alive—Bayard, the knight of
all others who has merited the motto, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans peur et sans
reproche</i>.” Of the lives and actions of such men, Henry
Bruntfield was a devout admirer and imitator. No young
knight kept a firmer seat upon his horse—none complained
less of the severities of campaigning—none cherished lady’s
love with a fonder, purer, or more devout sensation. On
first being introduced at the court of Henry the Third, he
had signalised, as a matter of course, Catherine Moubray,
the disinherited niece of his father’s murderer, who had been
educated in a French convent by her other relatives, and
was now provided for in the household of the queen. The
connection of this young lady with the tale of his own family,
and the circumstance of her being a sufferer in common
with himself by the wickedness of one individual,
would have been enough to create a deep interest respecting
her in his breast. But when, in addition to these circumstances,
we consider that she was beautiful, was highly
accomplished, and, in many other respects, qualified to engage
his affections, we can scarcely be surprised that <em>that</em>
was the result of their acquaintance. Upon one point
alone did these two interesting persons ever think differently.
Catherine, though inspired by her friends from
infancy with an entire hatred of her cruel relative, contemplated,
with fear and aversion, the prospect of her lover
being placed against him in deadly combat, and did all in
her power to dissuade him from his purpose. Love, however,
was of little avail against the still more deeply-rooted
passion which had previously occupied his breast. Flowers
thrown upon a river might have been as effectual in staying
its course towards the cataract, as the gentle entreaties
of Catherine Moubray in withholding Henry Bruntfield
from the enterprise for which his mother had reared him—for
which his brothers had died—for which he had all along
moved and breathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>At length, accomplished with all the skill which could
then be acquired in arms, glowing with all the earnest
feelings of youth, Henry returned to Scotland. On reaching
his mother’s dwelling, she clasped him, in a transport
of varied feeling, to her breast, and for a long time could
only gaze upon his elegant person. “My last and dearest,”
she at length said, “and thou too are to be adventured
upon this perilous course! Much have I bethought me
of the purpose which now remains to be accomplished. I
have not been without a sense of dread lest I be only doing
that which is to sink my soul in flames at the day of
reckoning; but yet there has been that which comforts me
also. Only yesternight I dreamed that your father appeared
before me. In his hand he held a bow and three
goodly shafts—at a distance appeared the fierce and sanguinary
Moubray. He desired me to shoot the arrows at that
arch traitor, and I gladly obeyed. A first and a second he
caught in his hand, broke, and trampled on with contempt.
But the third shaft, which was the fairest and goodliest of
all, pierced his guilty bosom, and he immediately expired.
The revered shade at this gave me an encouraging smile,
and withdrew. My Henry, thou art that <em>third arrow</em>,
which is at length to avail against the shedder of our blood.
The dream seems a revelation, given especially that I may
have comfort in this enterprise, otherwise so revolting to a
mother’s feelings.”</p>

<p>Young Bruntfield saw that his mother’s wishes had only
imposed upon her reason; but he made no attempt to
break the charm by which she was actuated, being glad,
upon any terms, to obtain her sanction for that adventure
to which he was himself impelled by feelings considerably
different. He therefore began, in the most deliberate manner,
to take measures for bringing on the combat with Moubray.
The same legal objections which had stood against
the second duel were maintained against the third; but
public feeling was too favourable to the object to be easily
withstood. The laird of Barnbougle, though somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
past the bloom of life, was still a powerful and active man,
and, instead of expressing any fear to meet this third and
more redoubted warrior, rather longed for a combat which
promised, if successful, to make him one of the most renowned
swordsmen of his time. He had also heard of the
attachment which subsisted between Bruntfield and his
niece; and, in the contemplation of an alliance which
might give some force to the claims of that lady upon his
estate, found a deeper and more selfish reason for accepting
the challenge of his youthful enemy. King James himself
protested against stretching the law of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per duellum</i>
so far; but, sensible that there would be no peace between
either the parties or their adherents till it should be decided
in a fair combat, he was fain to grant the required
licence.</p>

<p>The fight was appointed to take place on Cramond Inch,
a low grassy island in the Frith of Forth, near the castle
of Barnbougle. All the preparations were made in the
most approved manner by the young Duke of Lennox, who
had been the friend of Bruntfield in France. On a level
spot, close to the northern beach of the islet, a space was
marked off and strongly secured by a paling. The spectators,
who were almost exclusively gentlemen (the rabble
not being permitted to approach), sat upon a rising ground
beside the enclosure, while the space towards the sea was
quite clear. At one end, surrounded by his friends, stood
the laird of Barnbougle, a huge and ungainly figure, whose
features displayed a mixture of ferocity and hypocrisy, in
the highest degree unpleasing. At the other, also attended
by a host of family allies and friends, stood the gallant
Henry Bruntfield, who, if divested of his armour, might
have realised the idea of a winged Mercury. A seat was
erected close beside the barras for the Duke of Lennox and
other courtiers, who were to act as judges; and at a little
distance upon the sea lay a small decked vessel, with a
single male figure on board. After all the proper ceremonies
which attended this strange legal custom had been gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
through, the combatants advanced into the centre, and,
planting foot to foot, each with his heavy sword in his hand,
awaited the command which should let them loose against
each other, in a combat which both knew would only be
closed with the death of one or other. The word being
given, the fight commenced. Moubray, almost at the first
pass, gave his adversary a cut in the right limb, from which
the blood was seen to flow profusely. But Bruntfield was
enabled, by this mishap, to perceive the trick upon which
his adversary chiefly depended, and, by taking care to avoid
it, put Moubray nearly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hors de combat</i>. The fight then proceeded
for a few minutes, without either gaining the least
advantage over the other. Moubray was able to defend
himself pretty successfully from the cuts and thrusts of his
antagonist, but he could make no impression in return.
The question then became one of time. It was evident
that, if no lucky stroke should take effect beforehand, he
who first became fatigued with the exertion would be the
victim. Moubray felt his disadvantage as the elder and
bulkier man, and began to fight most desperately, and
with less caution. One tremendous blow, for which he
seemed to have gathered his last strength, took effect upon
Bruntfield, and brought him upon his knee, in a half-stupified
state; but the elder combatant had no strength to
follow up the effort. He reeled towards his youthful and
sinking enemy, and stood for a few moments over him,
vainly endeavouring to raise his weapon for another and
final blow. Ere he could accomplish his wish, Bruntfield
recovered sufficient strength to draw his dagger, and thrust
it up to the hilt beneath the breastplate of his exhausted
foe. The murderer of his race instantly lay dead beside
him, and a shout of joy from the spectators hailed him as
the victor. At the same instant, a scream of more than
earthly note arose from the vessel anchored near the island:
a lady descended from its side into a boat, and, rowing to
the land, rushed up to the bloody scene, where she fell
upon the neck of the conqueror, and pressed him, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the most frantic eagerness, to her bosom. The widow of
Stephen Bruntfield at length found the yearnings of twenty
years fulfilled—she saw the murderer of her husband, the
slayer of her two sons, dead on the sward before her,
while there still survived to her as noble a child as ever
blessed a mother’s arms. But the revulsion of feeling produced
by the event was too much for her strength; or, rather,
Providence, in its righteous judgment, had resolved
that so unholy a feeling as that of revenge should not be
too signally gratified. She expired in the arms of her son,
murmuring “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc dimittis, Domine</i>,” with her latest
breath.</p>

<p>The remainder of the tale of Bruntfield may be easily
told. After a decent interval, the young laird of Craighouse
married Catherine Moubray; and as the king saw it right
to restore that young lady to a property originally forfeited
for service to his mother, the happiness of the parties might
be considered as complete. A long life of prosperity and
peace was granted to them by the kindness of Heaven;
and at their death, they had the satisfaction of enjoying
that greatest of all earthly blessings, the love and respect
of a numerous and virtuous family.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PASSING_CROWD">THE PASSING CROWD.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“The Passing Crowd” is a phrase coined in the spirit of
indifference. Yet, to a man of what Plato calls “universal
sympathies,” and even to the plain ordinary denizens
of this world, what can be more interesting than “the
passing crowd?” Does not this tide of human beings,
which we daily see passing along the ways of this world,
consist of persons animated by the same spark of the divine
essence, and partaking of the same high destinies with ourselves?
Let us stand still but for a moment in the midst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of this busy and seemingly careless scene, and consider
what they are or may be whom we see around us. In
the hurry of the passing show, and of our own sensations,
we see but a series of unknown faces; but this is no reason
why we should regard them with indifference. Many
of these persons, if we knew their histories, would rivet
our admiration by the ability, worth, benevolence, or piety,
which they have displayed in their various paths through
life. Many would excite our warmest interest by their sufferings—sufferings,
perhaps, borne meekly and well, and
more for the sake of others than themselves. How many
tales of human weal and woe, of glory and of humiliation,
could be told by those beings, whom, in passing, we regard
not! Unvalued as they are by us, how many as good as ourselves
repose upon them the affections of bounteous hearts,
and would not want them for any earthly compensation!
Every one of these persons, in all probability, retains in
his bosom the cherished recollections of early happy days,
spent in some scene which “they ne’er forget, though there
they are forgot,” with friends and fellows who, though now
far removed in distance and in fortune, are never to be
given up by the heart. Every one of these individuals, in
all probability, nurses still deeper in the recesses of feeling,
the remembrance of that chapter of romance in the life of
every man, an early earnest attachment, conceived in the
fervour of youth, unstained by the slightest thought of self,
and for a time purifying and elevating the character far
above its ordinary standard. Beneath all this gloss of the
world—this cold conventional aspect, which all more or
less present, and which the business of life renders necessary—there
resides for certain a fountain of goodness, pure
in its inner depths as the lymph rock-distilled, and ready
on every proper occasion to well out in the exercise of
the noblest duties. Though all may seem but a hunt after
worldly objects, the great majority of these individuals can,
at the proper time, cast aside all earthly thoughts, and communicate
directly with the Being whom their fathers have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
taught them to worship, and whose will and attributes have
been taught to man immediately by Himself. Perhaps
many of these persons are of loftier aspect than ourselves,
and belong to a sphere removed above our own. But,
nevertheless, if the barrier of mere worldly form were taken
out of the way, it is probable that we could interchange
sympathies with these persons as freely and cordially as
with any of our own class. Perhaps they are of an inferior
order; but they are only inferior in certain circumstances,
which should never interpose to prevent the flow
of feeling for our kind. The great common features of human
nature remain; and let us never forget how much
respect is due to the very impress of humanity—the type
of the divine nature itself! Even where our fellow creatures
are degraded by vice and poverty, let us still be gentle
in our judging. The various fortunes which we every day see
befalling the members of a single family, after they part off
in their several paths through life, teach us that it is not
to every one that success in the career of existence is destined.
Besides, do not the arrangements of society at once
necessitate the subjection of an immense multitude to humble
toil, and give rise to temptations, before which the weak
and uninstructed can scarcely escape falling? But even
beneath the soiled face of the poor artizan, there may be
aspirations after some vague excellence, which hard fate has
denied him the means of attaining, though the very wish
to obtain it is itself ennobling. The very mendicant was
not always so; he, too, has had his undegraded and happier
days, upon the recollection of which, some remnant
of better feeling may still repose.</p>

<p>These, I humbly think, are reasons why we should not
look with coldness upon any masses of men with whom it
may be our lot to mingle. It is the nature of a good man
to conclude that others are like himself; and if we take the
crowd promiscuously, we can never be far wrong in thinking
that there are worthy and well-directed feelings in it as
well as in our own bosoms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_TALE_OF_THE_FORTY-FIVE">A TALE OF THE FORTY-FIVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Never, perhaps, did any city, upon the approach of a foreign
enemy, betray such symptoms of consternation and
disorder, as did Edinburgh, on the 16th of September 1745,
when it was understood that Prince Charles Edward, with
his army of Highlanders, had reached a village three miles
to the westward, unresisted by the civic corps in which the
hapless city had placed its last hopes of defence. A regiment
of dragoons, which had retreated on the previous day
from Stirling, and another which happened to be encamped
near Edinburgh, having joined their strengths to that of
the town-guard and volunteers, had that forenoon marched
boldly out of town, with the determined purpose of opposing
the rebels, and saving the town; but after standing
very bravely for a few hours at Corstorphine, the spectacle
of a single Highlander, who rode up towards them and
fired off his pistol, caused the whole of these gallant cavaliers
to turn and fly; nor did they stop till they had left
Edinburgh itself twenty miles behind. The precipitate
flight of regular troops was the worst possible example for
a body of raw, undisciplined citizens, who were too much
accustomed to the secure comforts of their firesides, to
have any relish for the horrors of an out-of-doors war with
the unscrupulous mountaineers. The consequence was,
that all retreated in confusion back to the city, where their
pusillanimity was the subject of triumphant ridicule to the
Jacobite party, and of shame and fear to the rest of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, as band after band poured through the
West Port, and filled the ample area of the Grassmarket,
the magistrates assembled in their council chamber, for the
purpose of “wondering what was to be done.” The result
of their deliberations was, that a full meeting of the
inhabitants should be held, in order that they might be
enabled to shape their course according to the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
opinion. Orders were immediately given to this effect,
and in the course of an hour, they found a respectable assemblage
of citizens, prepared, in one of the churches of
St Giles’s, to consider the important question of the defensibility
of the town.</p>

<p>The appearance of the city, on this dreadful afternoon,
was very remarkable, and such as we hope it will never
again exhibit. All the streets to the west of St Giles’s
were crowded with citizen volunteers, apparently irresolute
whether to lay down their arms or to retain them, and whose
anxious and crest-fallen looks communicated only despair to
the trembling citizens. The sound of hammers was heard
at the opening of every lane, and at the bottoms of all important
<em>turnpike</em> stairs, where workmen were busied in
mounting strong doors, studded thickly with nails, moving
on immense hinges, and bearing bolts and bars of no ordinary
strength—the well-known rapacious character of the
Highlanders, not less than their present hostile purpose,
having suggested this feeble attempt at security. The
principal street was encumbered with the large, tall, pavilion-roofed
family carriages of people of distinction, judges,
and officers of the crown, which, after being hastily crammed
with their proper burdens of live stock, and laden atop
with as much baggage as they could carry, one after
another wheeled off down the High Street, through the
Netherbow, and so out of town. A few scattered groups
of women, children, and inferior citizens, stood near that
old-accustomed meeting place, the Cross, round the tall
form of which they seemed to gather, like a Catholic population
clinging to a sacred fabric, which they suppose to
be endowed with some protecting virtue.</p>

<p>At the ordinary dinner hour, when the streets were as
usual in a great measure deserted, and while the assemblage
of citizens were still deliberating in the New Church
aisle, the people of the High Street were thrown into a
state of dreadful agitation, by a circumstance which they
witnessed from their windows. The accustomed silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
of “the hollow hungry hour” was suddenly broken by the
clatter of a horse’s feet upon the pavement; and on running
to their windows, they were prodigiously alarmed at
the sight of one of their anticipated foes riding boldly up
the street. Yet this alarm subsided considerably, when
they observed that his purpose seemed pacific, and that
he was not followed by any companions. The horseman
was a youth apparently about twenty years of age, with a
remarkably handsome figure and gallant carriage, which did
not fail in their effect upon at least the female part of the
beholders. The most robust Highland health was indicated
in his fair countenance and athletic form: and, in
addition to this, his appearance expressed just enough of
polish not to destroy the romantic effect produced by his
wild habiliments and striking situation. The tight tartan
trews showed well upon a limb, of which the symmetry
was never equalled by David Allan, the national painter,
so remarkable for his handsome Highland limbs, and of
which the effect, instead of being impaired by the clumsy
boot, was improved by the neat brogue, fastened as it was
to the foot by sparkling silver buckles. He wore a smart
round bonnet, adorned with his family cognisance—a bunch
of ivy—and from beneath which, a profusion of light brown
tresses, tied with dark ribbons, flowed, according to the
fashion of the time, about half way down his back. He
carried a small white flag in his hand, and bore about his
person the full set of Highland arms—broadsword, dirk,
and two silver-mounted pistols. Many a warm Jacobite
heart, male and female, palpitated at sight of his graceful
figure, and a considerable crowd of idle admirers, or wonderers,
followed him up the broad noble expanse of the
High Street.</p>

<p>By this crowd, who soon discovered that his purpose
was the delivery of a letter from the chevalier to the magistrates,
he was ushered forward to the opening of a narrow
passage, which in those days led through a pile of
buildings called the Luckenbooths, towards the door of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Haddo’s Hole Church, a passage called in the old Scottish
language a stile, which, moreover, was traversed in 1628
by King Charles the First, when he went to open the Scottish
Parliament in the High Tolbooth. Here the Highlander
dismounted, and after throwing his bridle over the
hook at a saddler’s door close to the corner of the stile,
was led forward into the lobby of the church, from which
the hum of active discussion was heard to proceed. On requesting
to be introduced to the magistrates, he was informed,
by an official wearing their livery, that the church
was so very much crowded, that “there would be nae possibility
of either getting him in to see the magistrates, or
the magistrates out to see him,” but that his letter might
be handed into them over the heads of the crowd. To
this expedient the messenger consented, and accordingly
it was immediately put in execution. In a few moments
after it had left the keeper’s hands, a dead silence seemed
to fall upon the company, and, after a renewed tumult and
a second silence, those who stood in the lobby heard a
voice reading a few words aloud, apparently those of the
letter. The voice was, however, interrupted in a few seconds
by the clamour of the whole assembled people, who
presently rose in confusion, and made a tumultuous rush
towards the door. On hearing and observing these alarming
symptoms, the city officer, with inconsiderate rashness,
thought it his duty to seize the author of so much supposed
mischief, and accordingly made a dash at the stranger’s collar,
calling upon the town-guardsmen present to close in
upon him, and intercept his retreat. But the prompt and
energetic Highlander was not to be so betrayed. With
a bound like the first movement of the startled deer, he
cleared the lobby, and made for his horse. Two dragoons
standing without, and who, observing the rush from the
door, threw themselves in the stranger’s way, were in the
same instant felled to the ground; and before any other
person could lay hands upon him, the maltreated messenger
threw himself upon his horse, drew his sword, and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
transport of rage shouted defiance to all around. Whirling
his weapon round his head, he stopped a few seconds
amidst the terrified crowd; and then, striking spurs into
his horse’s sides, rode along the street, still vociferating
loud defiances to all the detached military parties which he
met. No attempt, however, was made to prevent his escape,
or to offer him farther violence. One symptom of
offensive warfare alone occurred, and that originated in an
accident; for an old guardsman, who was overturned on
the causeway by the brush of the passing steed, could not
help discharging his redoubted piece; the shot, however,
doing no other harm than <em>winging</em> a golden peacock, which
overhung the window of a fashionable milliner in the fourth
flat of the Luckenbooths. After clearing the narrow defile
of the Luckenbooths, and getting into the full open street,
the Highland cavalier for once turned round, and, with a
voice broken by excess of indignation, uttered a thundering
malediction against all Edinburgh for its breach of the
articles of war, and a challenge to the prettiest man in it
who would meet him upon honourable terms. He then
galloped briskly down the High Street, still brandishing his
broadsword, the people making way for him on all sides,
by running down the numerous alleys leading from the
street, and terminated his daring exploit, unscathed and
undaunted, by passing out at the Netherbow Port, of which
the enormous folding doors, like the turnpikes in John Gilpin,
flew open at his approach.</p>

<p>It is irrelevant to our purpose to describe the consternation
under which the inhabitants of Edinburgh passed the
whole of that evening and night, or the real terror which
next morning seized them, when they understood that the
insurgents were in possession of the town. Moreover, as
it would not be proper to encumber our narrative with
well-known historical details, we shall also pass over the
circumstances in this remarkable civil war which followed
upon the capture of the city, and content ourselves with
relating the simple events of a love tale, in which the hero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
just introduced to the notice of our readers acted a conspicuous
part.</p>

<p>About a month after the rebels had entered Edinburgh,
and while Prince Charles Edward was still fondly lingering
in the palace which had sheltered so many of his ancestors,
a young gentlewoman, named Helen Lindsay, the daughter
of a whig writer to the signet in Edinburgh, was one fine
October evening taking a solitary walk in the King’s Park.
The sun had gone down over the castle, like the fire-shell
dropping into a devoted fortress, and the lofty edifices of
the city presented, on the eastern side, nothing but dark
irregular masses of shade. The park, which a little before
had been crowded with idle and well-dressed people, waiting
perhaps for a sight of the prince, was now deserted
by all except a few Highland soldiers, hurrying to or
from the camp at Duddingston, and by the young lady
above mentioned, who continued, in spite of the deepening
twilight, to saunter about, seeming to await the hour of
some assignation. As each single Highland officer or group
passed this lady, she contrived to elude their observation
by an adroit management of her plaid; and it was not till
the gathering darkness rendered her appearance at such a
time and place absolutely suspicious, that at length one gallant
mountaineer made bold to accost her. “Ah, Helen!”
he exclaimed, “how delighted am I to find you here;
for I expected you to be waiting at the bottom of the Walk—and
thus I see you five minutes sooner than I otherwise
would have done!” “I would rather wait near the palace
than at that fearsome place, at this time o’ nicht, William,”
said the young lady; “for, let me tell you, you have been
a great deal later o’ comin’ than you should have been.”
“Pardon me, my angel!” answered the youth; “I have
been detained by the prince till this instant. His royal
highness has communicated to me no very pleasant intelligence—he
is decisive as to our march commencing on the
morning after to-morrow, and I am distracted to think of
parting with you. How shall I—how can I part with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
you?” “Oh! never mind that, Willie,” cried the lady,
in a tone quite different from his, which was highly expressive
of a lover’s misery; “if your enterprise prove
successful, and you do not get your head broken, or beauty
spoilt, you shall perhaps be made an earl, and marry some
grand English countess; and I shall then content myself
with young Claver the advocate, who has been already so
warmly recommended to me by my father, and who would
instate me to-morrow, if I chose, as his wedded wife, in
the fine house he has just bought in Forrester’s Wynd.”
“To the devil with that beast!” cried the jealous lover
in Gaelic. “Do you think, Helen, that I could ever
marry any one but you, even though it were the queen on
the throne? But perhaps you are not so very resolute in
your love matters, and could transfer your affections from
one object to another as easily and as quickly as you could
your thoughts, or the glance of your eyes!” “Ah, Willie,
Willie,” said the lady, still in a jocular tone, “I see you are
a complete Hielanter—fiery and irritable. I might have
kenned that the first moment I ever saw ye, when ye bravadoed
a’ Edinburgh, because a silly toon-officer tried to
touch ye. Wad ye flee up, man, on your ain true love,
when she merely jokes ye a wee?” “Oh! if that be all,
Helen,” said the youth humbly, “I beg your grace. Yet,
methinks, this is no time for merriment, when we are about
to part, perhaps for ever. How, dearest Helen, do you
contrive to keep up your spirits under such circumstances?”
“Because,” said the young lady, “I know that there is
no necessity for us parting, at least for some time to come;
for I am willing to accompany you, if you will take me, to
the very world’s end. There’s sincerity and true love for
you!” Surprised and delighted with this frank offer, the
lover strained his mistress passionately to his bosom, and
swore to protect her as his lawful wife till the latest moment
of his existence. “You shall travel,” he said, “in
my sister Lady Ogilvie’s carriage, and be one of the first
British ladies to attend the prince’s levee in St James’s at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Christmas. Our marriage shall be solemnized at the end of
the first stage.” The project was less than rational; but
when was reason any thing to love? Many avowals of
mutual attachment passed between the parties; and, after
projecting a mode of elopement, they parted—William
Douglas taking the road for the camp at Duddingston, and
Helen Lindsay hastily returning to the town.</p>

<p>The morning of the 1st of November broke drearily
upon Edinburgh, showing a dull frosty atmosphere, and
the ground covered with a thin layer of snow. It was the
morning of the march; and here and there throughout the
streets stood a few bagpipers, playing a reveillé before the
lodgings of the great officers of the clans. One or two
chiefs were already marching down the street, preceded by
their pipers, and followed by their men, in order to join the
army, which was beginning to move from Duddingston.
The Highland guard, which had been stationed, ever since
the chevalier’s arrival, at the Weigh-house, was now leaving
its station, and moving down the Lawnmarket to the
merry sound of the bagpipe, when a strange circumstance
occurred.</p>

<p>Just as the word of command had been given to the
Weigh-house guard, the sash of the window in the third
floor of an adjacent house was pushed up, and immediately
after, a female figure was observed to issue therefrom, and
to descend rapidly along a rope towards the pavement below.
The commander of the guard no sooner perceived
this, than he sprang forwards to the place where the figure
was to alight, as if to receive her in his arms; but he did
not reach it before the lady, finding the rope too short by
several yards, dropped with a slight scream upon the
ground, where she lay apparently lifeless. The officer was
instantly beside her—and words cannot describe the consternation
and sorrow depicted in his face, as he stooped,
and with gentle promptitude lifted the unfortunate lady
from the ground. She had fainted with the pain of what
soon turned out to be a broken limb; and as she lay over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the Highlander’s arm, her travelling hood, falling back from
her head, disclosed a face which, though exquisitely beautiful,
was as pale and expressionless as death. A slight
murmur at length broke from her lips, and a tinge of red
returned to her cheeks, as she half articulated the word
“William.” William Douglas, for it was he, hung over
her in silent despair for a few moments, and was only recalled
to recollection when his men gathered eagerly and
officiously around him, each loudly inquiring of the other
the meaning of this strange scene. The noise thus occasioned
soon had the effect of bringing all to an understanding;
for the father of the lady, in a nightcap and morning
gown, was first observed to cast a hurried glance over the
still open window above, and was soon after in the midst
of the group, calling loudly and distractedly for his daughter,
and exclaiming vehemently against the person in whose arms
he found her, for having attempted to rob him of his natural
property. Douglas bethought himself for a moment,
and, calling upon his men to close all round him and the
lady, began to move away with his beloved burden, while
the old gentleman loaded the air with his cries, and struggled
forward with the vain intention of rescuing his daughter.
The lover might soon have succeeded in his wishes, by
ordering the remonstrant to be withheld, and taken home
by his men; but he speedily found that to take away his
mistress in her present condition, and without the means
of immediately relieving her, would be the height of cruelty;
and he therefore felt himself reluctantly compelled to resign
her to the charge of her parent, even at the risk of
losing her for ever. Old Mr Lindsay, overjoyed at this
resolution, offered to take his daughter into his own arms,
and transport her back to the house; but Douglas, heeding
not his proposal, and apparently anxious to retain his
mistress as long as he could, saved him this trouble, by
slowly and mournfully retracing his steps, and carrying her
up stairs to her bedchamber—his company meanwhile remaining
below. He there discovered that Helen had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
locked up by her father, who had found reason to suspect
her intention of eloping, and that this was what occasioned
her departure from the mode of escape previously agreed
upon. After depositing her still inanimate person carefully
on a bed, he turned for a moment towards her father, told
him fiercely that if he exercised any cruelty upon her in
consequence of what had taken place, he should dearly rue
it; and then, alter taking another silent, lingering, farewell
look of his mistress, left the house in order to continue his
march.</p>

<p>After this, another and longer interval occurs between
the incidents of our tale; and this may perhaps be profitably
employed in illustrating a few of the circumstances already
laid partially before the reader. William Douglas
was a younger son of Sir Robert Douglas of Glenbervie,
the celebrated antiquary, and had been bred to the profession
of a writer, or attorney, under the auspices of a
master of good practice in Aberdeen. Being, however, a
youth of sanguine temperament and romantic spirit, he did
not hesitate a moment, on hearing of the landing of the
chevalier, to break his apprenticeship, just on the point of
expiring, and set off to rank himself under the banners of
him whom he conceived entitled to the duty and assistance
of all true Scotsmen. In consideration of his birth, and his
connection with some of the very highest leaders in the
enterprise, he was appointed aide-de-camp to the prince,
in which capacity he had been employed to communicate
with the city in the manner already described. As he rode
up the High Street, and, more than that, as he rode down
again, he had been seen and admired by Helen Lindsay,
who happened to be then in the house of a friend near the
scene of his exploit. Soon after the Highland army had
taken possession of the city, they had met at the house of
a Jacobite aunt of the young lady, and a passion of the
tenderest nature then took place between them. To her
father, who was her only surviving parent, this was quite
unknown till the day before the departure of the Highlanders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
when some circumstances having roused his suspicions,
he thought it necessary to lock her up in her own
room, without, however, securing the window—that part
of a house, so useful and so interesting above all others to
youthful lovers, the chink of Pyramus and Thisbe not excepted.
It only remains to be stated, that though the young
lady recovered from the effects of her fall in a few weeks,
she did not so soon recover from her disappointment, and
she was doomed to experience a still greater affliction in
the strange look with which she was afterwards regarded
by her father and all her own acquaintance.</p>

<p>William Douglas performed an active part in all the
scenes of the rebellion, and finally escaped the perils of
Culloden almost without a wound. He fled to his father’s
house, where he was received joyfully, and concealed for
upwards of a twelvemonth, till the search of the royal
troops was no longer dangerous. His father frequently
entreated him to go abroad, but he would not consent to
such a measure; and at last, it being understood that government
had passed an “act of oblivion” in regard of the
surviving rebels, he ventured gradually and cautiously to
appear again in society. All this time he had never communicated
with Helen Lindsay, but his thoughts had often,
in the solitude of his place of hiding, turned anxiously
and fondly towards her. At length, to the surprise of his
father, he one day expressed his desire of going to Edinburgh,
and setting up there as a writer—the profession to
which he had been educated, and for which he could
easily complete his qualifications. Sir Robert was by no
means averse to his commencing business, but expressed
his fears for the safety of his son’s person in so conspicuous
a situation in the capital, where the eyes of justice were
constantly wide open, and where he would certainly meet
with the most disagreeable recognitions. The lover overruled
all these obstructions, by asking the old gentleman
whether he would wish to see his son perish in the West
Indies, or become a respectable and pacific member of society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
in his own country; and it was speedily arranged that
both should set out for Edinburgh, in order to put the
youth’s purpose in execution, so soon as he should procure
his indenture from his late master. In this no difficulty
was experienced; and in a few weeks the aged baronet set
forth, accompanied by his son, on horseback, towards the
city, which contained all the latter held dear on earth.</p>

<p>On arriving at an inn in the Canongate, the first thing
Sir Robert did, was to send a card to his cousin, the Earl
of ——, informing his lordship of his arrival, and begging
his company that evening at his hotel. The earl soon
made his appearance, heartily welcomed the old gentleman
to Edinburgh, and was introduced to young William. His
lordship was sorry, however, that he could not stay long
with them, as Lady —— was to have a ball that evening,
where his presence was, of course, indispensable. He
begged, however, to have the pleasure of <em>their</em> company at
his house so soon as they could dress, when he would endeavour
to entertain them, and, moreover, introduce his
young kinsman to the chief beauties of Edinburgh. When
he was gone, Sir Robert, alarmed at the idea of his son
entering at once into an assemblage where many would remember
his face, attempted to dissuade him from attending
the ball, and offered to remain all the evening with him in
the inn. But William insisted upon going, holding all danger
light, and representing to his father, that, even though
he were <em>recognised</em>, no one, even an enemy, would think
of <em>discovering</em> him, that being generally held as a sin of the
deepest dye. The truth was, that the earl’s mention of
<em>beauties</em> put him in mind of Miss Lindsay, and inspired him
with a notion that she would be of the party, and that he
might have an opportunity of renewing his acquaintance
with her, which he could not easily procure otherwise.
Both, therefore, prepared themselves for the ball, and, in a
short time, set off in two chairs for Gray’s Close, in which
the earl’s house was situated.</p>

<p>That fine old spacious alley was found to be, on the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
occasion, as splendid as it was possible for any close
in Auld Reekie to be, under the double advantages of fashion
and festivity. Two livery-men stood at the head
with torches, and served as a beacon to mark to the gathering
company the entrance of the strait into which they
had to steer their way. Between the head of the lane and
the vestibule of his lordship’s house, other servants were
planted with torches, so as to form an avenue of lights,
along which the guests were ushered. All the guests, as
they successively arrived, were announced at the head of
the stair by a servant—a custom recently adopted from
London, and of little service in Edinburgh, where all people
knew each other by sight. It served, however, on the
present occasion, to procure for Sir Robert and his son,
immediately on their entering the room, a general and instantaneous
attention, which they would rather have
dispensed with, and upon which they had not calculated.
Both gentlemen were personally presented by their kinsman,
the earl, to many persons of distinction of both sexes,
among whom Sir Robert (though he had been for twenty
years estranged in a great measure from society, in the
prosecution of his studies, and the management of his
gout) soon recognised and entered into conversation with
some old friends, while his son set himself to observe if
Miss Lindsay was in the room. She was not present;
but, as company continued still to arrive, he entertained
hopes that she would yet make her appearance. Disengaging
himself, therefore, from his father, he withdrew to
a corner of the room, where he might see, without being
easily perceived by any person entering; and there, in silence
and abstraction, he awaited her probable arrival.
Some minutes had elapsed after the last announcement;
and, in the idea that all were assembled, the earl had stood
up at the head of a long double line of powdered beaux,
and ladies with enormous hoops and high head-dresses, in
order to lead off the first dance, when William Douglas
heard the name of Mr and Miss Lindsay proclaimed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
head of the stair, and presently after saw an old precise-looking
gentleman lead into the room the elegant figure of
his long-lost mistress. He saw no more for some time;
for, while his blood rushed upwards to the heart in tumultuous
tide, a dimness came over his eyes, and obscured even
the brilliant chandeliers that hung over the company. On
recovering his powers of observation, the dance was done,
and the floor cleared of its revellers, who now sat all round
in full view. Some of the ladies were fanning themselves
vehemently with their large Indian fans; others were listening,
with head awry, to the compliments of their partners;
not a few were talking and coquetting with the
gentlemen near them, and a great portion were sitting demurely
and stiffly in groups, like hedgerow elms, under the
awful patronage of their mothers or protectresses: all were
companionable and looked happy, except one—a silent and
solitary one—who, less attractively dressed than any of the
rest, yet more beautiful than them all, sat pensively apart
from the throng, apparently taking little interest in what was
going on. Douglas needed no one to inform him that this
was Helen Lindsay, though she was very different from the
vivacious, sparkling girl she had been eighteen months before.
He was shocked at the change he observed, and
hastened to discover the cause, by inquiring of a silly-looking
young man near him who she was. “Oh! that is Miss
Lindsay,” quoth the youth, who was no other than her ancient
admirer, Claver, “said to be the prettiest girl in Edinburgh,
though Miss Pringle for my money—her you see with
a flame-coloured sack, sitting next to the Lord Justice Clerk.
To be sure, Miss Lindsay is not what she has been. I
was once thought in love with her (here he simpered), but
she was one morning found on the tramp with a rebel officer,
who is said to have been hanged, and she has never
since then held up her head as she used to do; for, indeed,
let me tell you, some of our great dames here affect
to hold up their noses at her adventures; so that, what
with a lippit character and a hanged sweetheart, you see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
she looks somewhat dismal on it.” Douglas durst make
no farther inquiries, but shrunk back in the seclusion and
concealment afforded by a corner of the room, from whence
he continued, for some time longer, to watch his unhappy
mistress—his father, in the meantime, completely taken off
his hands by a spectacled old maiden of quality, who had
engaged him in a genealogical disquisition. By watching
his opportunities, he contrived to place himself almost close
beside his mistress, without being observed, and, gradually
making still nearer approaches, he had at last the happiness
of finding himself upon the very next seat to her’s.
Whatever change disappointment and woe had wrought
in her, it did not amount to a fourth of that which William
had achieved in himself by a change of clothes, and
taming down, to the expression of domestic life, a visage
which had showed somewhat fierce and soldierly in the
days of his acquaintance with Miss Lindsay. Instead of
his former gallant and robust air, he was now pale and elegant;
and though his eye still retained some of its fire, and
his lip its wonted curve, the general change was such, and,
moreover, the circumstances under which he was now seen
were so different from those which surrounded and characterised
him, that before any but a lover’s eye, he might
have passed without recognition. As the case was, Miss
Lindsay discovered him at the first glance, and with difficulty
suppressing a scream, had nearly fainted with excessive
emotion. In the words of Scotland’s national
poet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She gazed, she redden’d like a rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Syne pale as ony lily.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">But she expressed no farther emotion. With presence of
mind which was not singular in those times of danger, she
instantly recovered her tranquillity, though her eyes could
not but express that she half-believed herself to be in the
presence of a being out of this world. One affectionate look
from William sufficed to put her alarm on that score to rest;
but she continued to feel the utmost apprehension respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
his safety, as well as a multitude of other confused emotions,
which fast awakened in her heart, as from his
imaginary grave, where they had long been buried, and
thronged tumultuously through her breast. A few words,
heard by no ears but hers, stealing under cover of the noise
made by the music and the dancers, like the rill under a
load of snow, conveyed to her the delightful intelligence
that he was still alive and her lover, and that he was come
thus late, when the days of peril seemed past, and under
happier auspices than before, to claim her affections.
When the dancers next arose upon the floor, he respectfully
presented his hand, and led her, nothing loath, into
the midst of the splendid assemblage, where Lord ——,
bustling about as master of the ceremonies, assigned them
an honourable place, in spite of the surprised looks and
reprobatory winks of not a few matrons as well as young
ladies. The handsome and well-matched pair acquitted
themselves to the admiration of the whole assemblage,
except the censorious and the envious; and when they sat
down together upon the same seats from which they had
risen, the speculation excited among the whole throng by
the unexpected appearance of such a pair, was beyond all
precedent in the annals of gossip.</p>

<p>Not long after, supper was announced, and the company
left the dancing-room in order to go down stairs to the apartment
where that meal was laid out. A ludicrous circumstance
now occurred, which we shall relate, rather because
it formed a part of the story, as told by our informant, than
from any connection it has with the main incident.</p>

<p>Sir Robert had all this time been so earnestly engaged in
the genealogical discussion alluded to, that, interesting as
the word supper always is on such occasions to those not
given to dancing alone, he did not hear it. It was not till
all were gone that he and the old spectacled lady discovered
at what stage of the proceedings they were arrived. Recollecting
his old-fashioned politeness, however, in proper
time, the venerable antiquary made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congé</i>, and offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
his hand to the tall, stiff, and rigid-looking dame, in order
to escort her, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more majorum</i>, down stairs. Sir Robert was
a man somewhat of the shortest, and, moreover, of the fattest,
while a gouty foot, carefully swaddled, gave an infirm
and tottering air to his whole person. As they moved along,
the two antiques would have reminded one of Sancho Panza
leading the distressed old spectacled duenna through the
dark labyrinths of the duke’s castle. Thus they went
along the room, down the earl’s narrow spiral stair, and
through an ill-lighted passage, he cringing and limping, as
gouty men are wont, and she sailing along, erect and dignified,
after the manner of an old maid of 1750, who had
seen good company at the Hunters’ Balls in Holyrood
House. Now, it so happened that a servant, or, as some
editions have it, a baker, had set down a small fruit pasty,
contained in an oval dish, in a dark corner of the passage,
intending immediately to return from the supper-room, to
which he had carried some other dishes, in order to rescue
it from that dangerous situation—to which, indeed, he had
been compelled to consign it, on finding that his hands were
already over-engaged. Before he returned, as ill luck would
have it, Sir Robert’s gouty and clouty foot alighted full in
the middle of the pasty, and stuck in it up to the ancle—perfectly
unconscious, however, in its swaddlings, of having
so shod itself, so that the good baronet walked on with it
into the room. What was his surprise, and what the mirth
of the company, and what the indignation of the old duenna,
on finding that she shared in the ridicule of her esquire,
may perhaps be imagined, but cannot be adequately described.
Suffice it to say, that the whole assemblage were
so delighted with the amusing incident, that not one face
exhibited any thing of gloom during the subsequent part of
the evening; and even the young ladies were tempted to
forget and forgive the good fortune of Miss Lindsay, in having,
to all appearance, so completely secured a first-rate
lover.</p>

<p>Our tale now draws to a conclusion, and may be summed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
up in a few words. William Douglas soon settled in
business as a writer to the signet, and found no obstacle
on the part of either his parent or his mistress in uniting
himself to that amiable young lady. It was known to a
few, and suspected by more, that under the decent habit
he now wore was concealed the very person who knocked
down two of Gardener’s dragoons in the Luckenbooths,
and braved all Edinburgh to single combat. But he was
never molested on this account; and he therefore continued
to practise in the Court of Session for upwards of half
a century, with the success and with the credit of a respectable
citizen.</p>

<p class="no-indent">There is an allegory in the Spectator, called, if I recollect
rightly, “The Mountain of Miseries.” It narrates how
the human race were once summoned by a good Genius
to a particular spot, and each permitted to cast down the
misery which most afflicted him, taking up some one which
had belonged to a fellow-creature, and which he thought
he should be more able to endure. Some cast down diseased
limbs, some bad wives, and so forth; but the end
of the story is, that after the exchange had been made,
all felt themselves a great deal more uneasy under their
adopted evils than they had ever felt under their natural
ones, and, accordingly, had to petition the Genius for permission
to take back each his own proper original misery.
I have often thought that the practice of removing from
one house to another, in the hope of finding better ease
and accommodation, was not much unlike this grand general
interchange of personal distresses; and often on a Whitsunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
in Scotland, when I have seen people flying in all
directions with old tables and beds, that would have looked
a great deal better in their native homes than on the street,
I have mentally compared the scene to that which is so
graphically described by Addison.</p>

<p>The English, it seems, are not much of a removing
people. When a Southron once settles himself down in
a house, he only quits it with the greatest reluctance. No
matter for an increasing family—no matter for bettered
circumstances—no matter for the ambition of wife or daughters
to get into a genteeler neighbourhood. An Englishman
has naturally a strong feeling about his house: it is
his castle, and he never will abandon the fort so long as
he can possibly retain it. Give him but a few years’ associations
to hallow the dwelling—let him have been married
in it, and there spent the years of the youth of his
children; and sooner than part from the dear little parlour
where he has enjoyed so many delightful evening scenes,
with his young spouse and his happy infants around him,
he would almost part with life itself. An Englishman gets
accommodated to all the inconveniences of his house, however
great, as naturally as the fish with its shell, however
tortuous. Some strange angularity in his vestibule, which
nearly throws you down every time you visit him, may appear
to you a most disagreeable crook in his lot, and one
that ought to make the house intolerable to him; but, ten
to one, he looks upon it as only an amiable eccentricity in
the plan of the mansion, and, so far from taking ill with it,
would feel like a fish out of water if it were otherwise.</p>

<p>The Scotch, on the contrary, are an eminently migratory
people. They never are three months in any house
till they wish that the annual term were once more at
hand, when they might remove to another. There is no
day in the year so important in their eyes as Whitsunday,
when almost the whole population of every considerable
town is found to be on the move, exchanging houses with
each other. This is a curious feature in the people, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
seems as if it only could be accounted for by supposing
that the nation is totally deficient in the phrenological organ
called <em>inhabitiveness</em>. It is all to no use that experience is
constantly showing how vain are their expectations of better
lodging. Every disappointment seems to give them but
a keener relish for a new attempt.</p>

<p>The fact is this: A family always enters upon a new house
in a state of high hope as to its accommodations. So long
as the recollection of their deserted abode is still fresh,
the new house appears a paradise; for, mark, it has been
selected on the express account of its not being characterised
by any one of the inconveniences alleged against the
old. By and bye, however, its own peculiar evils are felt;
and, long before Candlemas day, it has been found as disagreeable
as the other. Then a new one is selected, which,
in its turn, is declared as bad as any. So far as my observation
has extended, the itch for removing more generally
prevails among the female than the male department of
the population. Husbands in general are too little in the
house ever to fall out of conceit with it; but the wife, as
the more domestic creature, has full opportunity to observe
and feel its defects; and she it is who most frequently urges
and achieves the removal. There are various things about
a house in which the husband can never see any importance,
or feel any interest, but which appear to the wife as
each the most cardinal of all cardinal points. One of these,
for instance, is a back-green. “A back-green!” let the
words be pronounced with a solemnity befitting their awful
import. Often, when a house has seemed to the husband
all that could be desired, he has been thrust out of
it, whether he would or not, all on account of a thing
which was as inexplicable to him as the mysteries of the
Chinese faith—a back-green. Perhaps you hear some day
that your back-green lies totally out of the sun, or that the
right use to it is shared by some disagreeable neighbours,
or is naught for some other equally intelligible reason. But
you learn no more, and next Whitsunday you find yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
in the horrors and agonies of a removal to some distant
part of the town, all on account of a little space of ground,
of which you never yet could guess the use or purpose.
Very often you are removed from a comfortable and every
way excellent house, because it wants a back-green, and
taken to one every way inferior, and, indeed, utterly
wretched, but which, in the eyes of your sweet spouse,
is rendered equal to a palace—because it has a back-green.
I would advise all husbands to keep a sharp look-out after
the back-greens, as well as several other things, which I
shall point out to them.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a case of proposed removal in the middle
walks of life. You are, say, the father of a rather numerous
family, living very contentedly in a <em>flat</em> in not the
least dense part of the town. For a long time there have
been grumblings, like distant thunder among the mountains;
but you have never yet heard any very strong reason urged
why you should remove. At length, about the New Year,
these mutterings begin to get voice; and your wife, some
quiet evening, after all the young people are gone to bed,
opens a sudden and most tremendous attack upon you,
respecting the necessity of no longer keeping the children
pent up in this small dwelling, so far from any play-ground
or fresh air. And, really, she does not think it is good for
her own health that you should live any longer here. She
has plenty of exercise, she acknowledges, but no air. It
is so far from public walks, that it makes a toil of a pleasure
before they can be reached. And then, no place
whatsoever to dry the clothes. Your own shirts are never
properly seen to, being only hung in an open garret, where
they are exposed to all the smoke of the town; at least,
all that chooses to come in at the skylights. And there is
no such thing as a servant’s bed-room in this house. The
girl, I assure you, has her own complaints as to the hardship
of being obliged to sleep in that den above the kitchen
door. And as for the stair, is it not a thoroughfare to all
the scum of the town? Some of the neighbours, I assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
you, are no better than they should be, if all tales be true.
There is even an old man in the garret who is supposed to
live by <em>Burking</em>. The fact is, we would now require an
additional bed-room for the boys—&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Lectured up to removing point, you consent, unhappy
man! to leave your shop some forenoon, in order to take
a walk with your wife about the outskirts of the town, in
search of a more airy, more spacious, and more genteel
abode. You are dragged “by the lug and the horn,”
as shepherds say, through multitudes of those “delightful
small <em>self-contained</em> houses,” which offer, “within twenty
minutes’ walk of the college,” all the elegancies of Heriot
Row and Great King Street, at a tithe of the rent. You
find them all as like each other in the interior as if they
had been made on the principle of chip-boxes; but yet, to
your wife, each seems to have its own peculiar merits.
One excels in the matter of a lobby; another has an extra
closet; a third affords a superior view from the drawing-room
windows; and a fourth—O merit above all merits!—transcends
its fellows in the article of a back-green.
Every thing, however, is inspected—every thing is taken
into the general account; and the result of the whole is,
that though the rent is ten pounds higher, and the dining-room
a thought less than in your present abode, you <em>must</em>
remove. The carpets, with a very little eeking and clipping,
will all suit. Your sideboard, of which your spouse has a
measure in her reticule, will exactly answer the recess devoted
to it. The jack in the kitchen answers to a tee;
and even the scraper at the door has something about it
that is singularly appropriate, as if the builder at the very
first had designed to take the measure of your foot. All
things appear, in the showing of your good dame, to be so
remarkably answerable and proper, that you half believe it
to be a matter of destiny, and, in completing your arrangements,
hardly bargain so much with the landlord as with
Fate.</p>

<p>During the spring months which elapse before the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
of removal, you live in a state of dreamy bliss respecting
your new house. Almost every fine morning you rise
about seven for a walk, and, by a strange chance, you invariably
take the house of promise in your way, and enjoy
a survey of its external excellencies. When you observe,
from the closed shutters, that its present occupants, so far
from being agog about it like yourself, are snugly snoozing
in their beds, you wonder at their indifference. If you
were they, you would have been up hours ago, enjoying
the air in the back-green, or playing the king of the Vandals
in the front-plot. What a pity to see that splendid
ruin of a rhododendron drooping in that fashion! What
a shame to pay so little attention to the boxwood! At
length, the 25th of May arrives. You transfer yourself to
the now vacated tenement, pitying with all your heart the
stupid people who have left it. For a time, a kind of honeymoon
delirium pervades the household. You certainly do
find some pleasure in contemplating from your drawing-room
windows the cattle in the neighbouring grass-park,
even though sensible all the time that they are only kept
there <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in petto</i> by the exterminating butcher at the end of “the
Row.” Your wife, too, reposes upon the joys of her back-green
with a gratulation of spirit that seems as if it could
never know an end. And while the servant girl rejoices
in a chamber to herself, your boys have sport unceasing in
pasting over the kitchen door with pictures and excellent
new songs. But all this only holds good while summer
lasts—summer, during which no house ever appears inconvenient
or disadvantageous. By and bye comes the winter
of your discontent. The views from the window are
no longer fair; the back-green, which already in autumn
had begun to lose its character as a play-ground, in consequence
of the swarms of creeping things, which covered
the walls in such a way as if they had a design to form a
living entomological museum, and so fairly frightened the
children into the house, is now a sink of mud and melting
snow; the serving-wench finds that it was better to sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
in “that den above the kitchen door”—in so far as the said
den was very “cosey”—than to lie in a chamber under the
slates, exposed to the malevolence of the elements in all
its shapes. You find, too, that in the short days it is not
very agreeable to walk several times to and from town in
the dark, through a district which, in the language of
house-proprietors, “has the advantage of being out of
the bounds of police.” The phrase, “within twenty
minutes’ walk of the College,” appears to you as only
calculated for the faculties of some itinerating prodigy, in
as much as it never takes you less than twice the time.
The worthy housewife herself, after long suffering in secret,
and great reluctance to confess her counsel wrong, has to
complain at last of “the distance from the market,” which
obliges her to buy every thing from small dealers in the
neighbourhood, who necessarily must make up for uncertain
custom by “two prices.” No getting so much as a pennyworth
of vegetables without sending for it nearly a mile;
and then “that creature Jenny,” there is no sending her
out, you know, even upon the shortest errand, but she
stays an hour. When we want even so much as change
for a shilling, there is no getting it nearer than Port Hopetoun,
which is half a mile away. Then we are such a distance
from the kirk. It is only in fine weather we are able
to get that length, and at most only once in the day. I
declare, if we stay here much longer, we shall become absolute
heathens. Although, to be sure, we pay less taxes
in this out-of-the-way place than we did before, have we
not lost a washing-tub, from there being no police? And
then, is there not a toll-bar betwixt us and the town, at
which we must pay one shilling every time we have to go
out or come home in a coach? And, above all things, we
are cut off here from all our friends and acquaintances.
We do not know a soul nearer hand than the Duncans,
who live at the back of the Meadows. And there is no
dropping in here, in an easy way, upon a forenoon call,
but the people, when they reach us, are so much fatigued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
with the distance, that they must be asked to stay to dinner:
and the case ends, perhaps, with the good man being
obliged to walk three miles home with a young lady at
twelve o’clock at night! Only think of that! No, no,
this cold, outlandish, genteel place, will never do. Give
me a good front door in the New Town, “with all the conveniences,”
and I’ll leave such places as this to them that
like them better.</p>

<p>When once a resolution is formed to leave a house, it is
amazing how many holes are picked in its character, many
of them literal. The wind gets in at a hundred places;
we can see daylight through stone walls and double-deafened
ceilings. Then, there is such a draught up the staircase,
and into the best bed-room, that positively there is
no enduring it. I think another six months of this house
would fairly make an end of <em>me</em>. It’s not a house for tender
folk. You might sometimes as well sit in the open
street, as by the fireside. You burn your shins, and all
the time your back is freezing. Upon my word, I think
we should save all the difference between this and a front
door in doctors’ bills!</p>

<p>A front door is then determined upon; and you think
you have at length, by a little stretch of your purse, reached
the very perfection of comfort. But alas! “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fronti nulla
fides</i>,” which is as much as to say, there is no reliance to
be placed on a front door. It is true, you escape all the
evils of your former habitation, and that nothing can match
your back kitchen as a convenience to the servants. But
then the family living above you has twice your number of
children; and these imps seem to do nothing whatever the
whole day long, from six in the morning till seven at night,
but run pat, pat, pat, along the floors overhead, till they
almost drive you mad, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non vi sed sæpe cadendo</i>. Even the
charms of a back-green, or a superior scullery, will not
stand against this; and so you determine at last to go to
an upper flat in the same neighbourhood, where you may
have the pleasure of tormenting some person below with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
<em>your</em> children, without the risk of being at the same time
tormented yourself. The last selection is made upon moderate
and prudent principles; but yet hope is also even
here upon the wing. The house has no pretensions to
style or external gentility, but yet “Edwin was no vulgar
boy.” The stair is remarkably spacious and well lighted,
and has, further, the advantage of a door at the bottom,
which can be opened by any inhabitant, by means of a pulley,
without the necessity of descending to the bottom.
In fact, it is what I would call a genteel stair. “The Stevensons”
live in the first <em>flat</em>. The kitchen door has a nice
hole at the lower corner for the cat; and what a delightful
place there is by the side of the fire for the lamp, or where
we could keep our salt dry in a <em>pig</em>! The request of the
Regent Earl of Mar, as inscribed on the front of his house
at Stirling,</p>

<p class="no-indent">comes powerfully into force in all cases where the tenant is
just entering upon his house. As in the other case every
fault is exaggerated, and made the subject of congratulatory
disgust, so in this, every fault is extenuated. “The ceilings
are a little contracted, I see, by the roof.” “Oh! a
wee thought coomceyled—a very small matter; these rooms
are only intended for the children. We have some capital
<em>public</em> rooms at the back, looking into the Queen Street
gardens, and have a little peep of the sea in the distance.”
“Upper flats,” observes your Malagrowther friend, “are
very apt to smoke.” “Oh! not at all, I assure you. But
I have been assured that Dr Bonnyman cured this house
entirely some years ago, and since then there has never been
a single puff of smoke.” “Your nursery is in the garret;
don’t you think the children will feel it rather cold?” “Oh,
the most comfortable nursery in the world; and see, <em>only
see</em>, what a nice door there is at the top of the garret stair
to prevent the bairns from tumbling down!” “I am
sorry, however, to see a green-wife established so close beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the door, at the bottom of your <em>common</em> stair.” “Oh,
Sir, but consider the convenience of the greens.” In fact,
there is no peculiarity about the house, however trifling,
but, in the eyes of a new tenant, it will seem a beauty, as in
those of a departing one it will constitute a disgrace. And
this is just the philosophy of the question, and the real
cause why there is so much useless tossing and tumbling
of old furniture on each 25th of May.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The industrious classes of the middle rank are, on the one
hand, <em>attracted onwards</em> to wealth and respectability, by
contemplating men, formerly of their own order, who having,
as the saying is, feathered their nests, now lie at ease,
a kind of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conscripti patres</i>; while they are, on the other
hand, <em>repelled</em> from the regions of poverty and disgrace by
the sight of a great many wretched persons, who having,
under the influence of some unhappy star, permitted their
good resolutions of industry and honour to give way, are
sunk from their former estate, and now live—if living it can
be called—in a state of misery and ignominy almost too painful
to be thought of. There may be a use in this—as there
is a use for beacons and buoys at sea. But oh, the desolation
of such a fate! As different as the condition of a
vessel which ever bends its course freely and gallantly over
the seas, on some joyous expedition of profit or adventure,
compared with one which has been deprived of all the
means of locomotion, and chained down upon some reef
of rocks, merely to tell its happier companions that it is to
be avoided; so different is the condition of a man still engaged
in the hopeful pursuits of life, and one who has lost
all its prospects.</p>

<p>The progress of men who live by their daily industry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
through this world, may be likened, in some respects, to
the march of an army through an enemy’s country. He
who, from fatigue, from disease, from inebriety, from severe
wounds, or whatever cause, falls out of the line of
march, and lays him down by the wayside, is sure, as a
matter of course, to be destroyed by the peasantry; once
let the column he belongs to pass on a little way ahead,
and death is his sure portion. It is a dreadful thing to fall
behind the onward march of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Victims</span>—the word placed at the head of this article—is
a designation for those woe-begone mortals who have had
the misfortune to drop out of the ranks of society. Every
body must know more or less of <em>victims</em>, for every body
must have had to pay a smaller or greater number of half-crowns
in his time to keep them from starvation. It happens,
however, that the present writer has had <em>a great deal
to do with victims</em>; and he therefore conceives himself qualified
to afford his neighbours a little information upon the
subject. It is a subject not without its moral.</p>

<p>A <em>victim</em> may become so from many causes. Some men
are wrong placed in the world by their friends, and ruin
themselves. Some are ill married, and lose heart. Others
have tastes unsuited to the dull course of a man of business,
as for music, social pleasures, the company of men
<em>out of their own order</em>, and so forth. Other men have natural
imperfections of character, and sink down, from pure
inability to compete with rivals of more athletic constitution.
But the grand cause of declension in life is inability
to accommodate circumstances and conduct.</p>

<p>Suppose a man to have broken credit with the world,
and made that treaty of perpetual hostility with it, which,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi lucus a non lucendo</i>, is called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cessio bonorum</i>—what
is he to do next? One thing is dead clear: he no more
appears on Prince’s Street or the bridges. They are to
him as a native and once familiar land, from which he is
exiled for ever. His migrations from one side of the
town to the other are now accomplished by by-channels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
which, however well known to our ancestors, are in the
present day dreamt of by nobody, except, perhaps, the
author of the Traditions of Edinburgh. I once came full
upon a <em>victim</em> in Croftangry, a wretched alley near the
Palace of Holyrood House; he looked the very Genius of
the place! But the ways of <em>victims</em> are in general very
occult. Sometimes I have altogether lost sight of one for
several years, and given him up for dead. But at length
he would re-appear amidst the crowd at a midnight fire, as
salmon come from the deepest pools towards the lighted
sheaf of the fisherman, or as some old revolutionary names
that had disappeared from French history for a quarter of
a century, came again above board on the occasion of the
late revolution at Paris. At one particular conflagration,
which happened some years ago, I observed several <em>victims</em>,
who had long vanished from the open daylight streets,
come out to glare with their bleared eyes upon the awful
scene—perhaps unroosted from their dens by the progress
of the “devouring element.” But—what is a <em>victim</em> like?</p>

<p>The progress of a <em>victim’s</em> gradual deterioration depends
very much upon the question, whether he has, according
to the old joke, failed with a waistcoat or a full suit. Suppose
the latter contingency: he keeps up a decent appearance
for some months after the fatal event, perhaps even making
several attempts to keep up a few of his old acquaintance.
It won’t do, however; the clothes get worn—threadbare—slit—torn—patched—darned;
let ink, thread, and judicious
arrangement of person, do their best. The hat,
the shoes, and the gloves, fail first; he then begins to wear
a suspicious deal of whitey-brown linen in the way of cravat.
Collars fail. Frills retire. The vest is buttoned to
the uppermost button, or even, perhaps, with a supplementary
pin (a pin is the most squalid object in nature or
art) at top. Still at this period he tries to carry a jaunty,
genteel air; he has not yet all forgot himself to rags. But,
see, the buttons begin to show something like new moons at
one side; these moons become <em>full</em>; they <em>change</em>; and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the button is only a little wisp of thread and rags, deprived
of all power of retention over the button-hole. His watch
has long been gone to supply the current wants of the day.
The vest by and bye retires from business, and the coat is
buttoned up to the chin. About this period, he perhaps
appears in a pair of nankeen trousers, which, notwithstanding
the coldness of the weather, he tries to sport in an easy,
genteel fashion, as if it were his taste. If you meet him at
this time, and inquire how he is getting on in the world,
he speaks very confidently of some excellent situation he
has a prospect of, which will make him better than ever;
it is perhaps to superintend a large new blacking manufactory
which is to be set up at Portobello, and for which two
acres of stone bottles, ten feet deep, have already been
collected from all the lumber-cellars in the country; quite
a nice easy business; nothing to do but collect the orders
and see them executed; good salary, free house, coal, candle,
and <em>blacking</em>; save a pound a-year on the article of
blacking alone. Or it is some other <em>concern</em> equally absurd,
but which the disordered mind of the poor unfortunate is
evidently rioting over with as much enjoyment as if it were
to make him once more what he had been in his better
days. At length—but not perhaps till two or three years
have elapsed—he becomes that lamentable picture of
wretchedness which is his ultimate destiny; a mere pile
of clothes without pile—a deplorable—a <em>victim</em>.</p>

<p>As a picture of an individual <em>victim</em>, take the following:—My
earliest recollections of Mr Kier refer to his keeping a
seed-shop in the New Town of Edinburgh. He was a
remarkably smart active man, and could tie up little parcels
of seeds with an almost magical degree of dispatch. When
engaged in that duty, your eye lost sight of his fingers
altogether, as you cease to individualise the spokes of a
wheel when it is turned with great rapidity. He was the
inventor of a curious tall engine, with a peculiar pair of
scissors at top, for cutting fruit off trees. This he sent
through Prince’s Street every day with one of his boys, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
was instructed every now and then to draw the string, so
as to make the scissors close as sharply as possible. The
boy would watch his men—broad-skirted men with top-boots—and,
gliding in before them, would make the thing
play <em>clip</em>. “Boy, boy,” the country gentleman would cry,
“what’s that?” The boy would explain; the gentleman
would be delighted with the idea of cutting down any particular
apple he chose out of a thickly laden and unapproachable
tree; and, after that, nothing more was required than
to give him the card of the shop. Mr Kier, however, was
not a man of correct or temperate conduct. He used to indulge
even in forenoon potations. Opposite to his shop
there was a tavern, to which he was in the habit of sending
a boy every day for a tumbler of spirits and water, which
the wretch was carefully enjoined to carry under his apron.
One day the boy forgot the precaution, and carried the
infamous crystal quite exposed in his hand across the open
and crowded street. Mr Kier was surveying his progress
both in going and returning; and when he observed him
coming towards the shop, with so damnatory a proof of his
malpractices holden forth to the gaze of the world, he
leaped and danced within his shop window like a supplejack
in a glass case. The poor boy came in quite innocently,
little woting of the crime he had committed, or the reception
he was to meet with, when, just as he had deposited the
glass upon the counter, a blow from the hand of his master
stretched him insensibly in a remote corner of the shop,
among a parcel of seed-bags. As no qualities will succeed
in business unless perfectly good conduct be among the
number, and, above all things, an absence from tippling,
Kier soon became a <em>victim</em>. After he first took to the
<em>bent</em>, to use Rob Roy’s phrase, I lost sight of him for two
or three years. At length I one day met him on a road
a little way out of town. He wore a coat buttoned to the
chin, and which, being also very long in the breast, according
to a fashion which obtained about the year 1813, seemed
to enclose his whole trunk from neck to groin. With the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
usual cataract of cravat, he wore a hat the most woe-begone,
the most dejected, the most melancholy I had ever
seen. His face was inflamed and agitated, and as he
walked, he swung out his arms with a strange emphatic expression,
as if he were saying, “I am an ill-used man, but
I’ll tell it to the world.” Misery had evidently given him
a slight craze, as it almost always does when it overtakes
a man accustomed in early life to better things. Some
time afterwards I saw him a little revivified through the
influence of a <em>new second-hand coat</em>, and he seemed, from
a small leathern parcel which he bore under his arm, to be
engaged in some small agency. But this was a mere flash
before utter expiration. He relapsed to the Cowgate—to
rags—to wretchedness—to madness—immediately after.
When I next saw him, it was in that street, the time midnight.
He lay in the bottom of a stair, more like a heap
of mud than a man. A maniac curse, uttered as I stumbled
over him, was the means of my recognising it to be
Kier.</p>

<p>The system of life pursued by <em>victims</em> in general, is worthy
of being inquired into. <em>Victims</em> hang much about taverns
in the outskirts of the town. Perhaps a decent man from
Pennycuik, with the honest rustic name of Walter Brown,
or James Gowans, migrates to the Candlemaker Row, or
the Grassmarket, and sets up a small public house. You
may know the man by his corduroy spatterdashes, and the
latchets of his shoes drawn through them by two pye-holes.
He is an honest man, believing every body to be as honest
as himself. Perhaps he has some antiquated and prescribed
right to the stance of a hay-stack at Pennycuik,
and is not without his wishes to try his fortune in the Parliament
House. Well, the <em>victims</em> soon scent out his
house by the glare of his new sign—the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novitas regni</i>—and
upon him they fall tooth and nail. Partly through simplicity,
partly by having his feelings excited regarding the
stance of the hay-stack, he gives these gentlemen some
credit. For a while you may observe a flocking of <em>victims</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
toward his doorway, like the gathering of clean and unclean
things to Noah’s ark. But it is not altogether a case
of deception. <em>Victims</em>, somehow or other, occasionally
<em>have</em> money. True, it is seldom in greater sums than sixpence.
But then, consider the importance of sixpence to
a flock of <em>victims</em>. Such a sum, judiciously managed, may
get the whole set meat and drink for a day. At length,
when Walter begins to find his barrels run dry, with little
return of money wherewithal to replenish them, and when
the joint influence of occasional apparitions of sixpence,
and the stance of the hay-stack at Pennycuik, has no longer
any effect upon him, why, what is to be done but fly to
some other individual, equally able and willing to bleed?</p>

<p>One thing is always very remarkable in <em>victims</em>, namely,
their extraordinary frankness and politeness. A <em>victim</em>
might have been an absolute bear in his better days; but
hunger, it is said, will tame a lion, and it seems to have
the same effect in subduing the asperities of a <em>victim</em>.
Meet a <em>victim</em> where you will—that is, before he has become
altogether deplorable—and you are amazed at the
bland, confidential air which he has assumed; so different,
perhaps, from what he sported in better days. His manner,
in fact, is most insinuating—into your pocket; and if
you do not get alarmed at the symptoms, and break off in
time, you are brought down for half a crown as sure as you
live. <em>Victims</em> keep up a kind of constant <em>civil</em> war with
shops. They mark those which have been recently opened,
and where they see only young men behind the counter.
They try to establish a kind of credit of face, by now and
then dropping in and asking, in a genteel manner, for a
sight of a Directory, or for a bit of twine, or for “the <em>least</em>
slip of paper,” occasionally even spending a halfpenny or
a penny in a candid, honourable way, with all the air of a
person wishing to befriend the shop. In the course of
these “transactions,” they endeavour to excite a little conversation,
beginning with the weather, gradually expanding
to a remark upon the state of business; and, perhaps, ending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
with a sympathising inquiry as to the prospects which
the worthy shopkeeper himself may have of succeeding in
his present situation. At length, having laid down what
painters call a <em>priming</em>, they come in some day, in a hurried
fiddle-faddle kind of way, and hastily and confidentially ask
across the counter, “Mr——[victims are always particular
in saying <em>Master</em>], have you got such a thing as fourpence
in ha’pence? I just want to pay a porter, and happen to
have no change.” The specification of “fourpence in ha’pence,”
though in reality nonsense, carries the day; it gives
a plausibility and credit-worthiness to the demand that
could not otherwise be obtained. The unfortunate shopkeeper,
carried away by the contagious bustle of the <em>victim</em>,
plunges his hand, quick as thought, into the till, and before
he knows where he is, he is minus a groat, and the <em>victim</em>
has vanished from before him—and the whole transaction,
reflected upon three minutes afterwards, seems as if it had
been a dream.</p>

<p>The existence of a <em>victim</em> is the most precarious thing,
perhaps, in the world. He is a man with no continuing
dinner-place. He dines, as the poor old Earl of Findlater
used to say, at the sign of the Mouth. It is a very strange
thing, and what no one could suppose <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, that the
necessitous are greatly indebted to the necessitous. People
of this sort form a kind of community by themselves, and
are more kind to each other mutually than is any other particular
branch of the public to them as a class. Thus, the
little that any one has, is apt to be shared by a great many
companions, and all have a mouthful. The necessitous
are also very much the dupes of the necessitous: they are
all, as it were, creatures of prey, the stronger constantly
eating up the weaker. Thus, a <em>victim</em> in the last stage preys
upon men who are entering the set; and all prey more or
less upon poor tradesmen, such as the above Walter Brown
or James Gowans, who are only liable to such a spoliation
because they are poor, and anxious for business. We have
known a <em>victim</em>, for instance, who had long passed the condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of being <em>jail-worthy</em>, live in a great measure upon a
man who had just begun a career of victimization by being
thrown into jail. This creature was content to be a kind
of voluntary prisoner for the sake of sharing the victuals
and bed of his patron. It would astonish any man, accustomed,
day after day, to go home to a spread table at a regular
hour, to know the strange shifts which victims have to
make in order to satisfy hunger—how much is done by raising
small hard-wrung subsidies from former acquaintance—how
much by duping—how much by what the Scotch people
very expressively call <em>skeching</em>—how much by subdivision
of mites among the wretches themselves. Your <em>victim</em> is
often witty, can sing one good comic song, has a turn for
mimicry, or at least an amusing smack of worldly knowledge;
and he is sometimes so lucky as to fall in with
patrons little above himself in fortune, but still having
something to give, who afford him their protection on account
of such qualifications.</p>

<p>By way of illustrating these points, take the following
instances of what may be called the <em>fag-victim</em>.</p>

<p>Nisbet of ——, in Lanarkshire, originally a landed gentleman
and an advocate at the Scottish bar, was a blood
of the first water in the dissolute decade 1780-90, when,
if we are to believe Provost Creech, it was a gentleman’s
highest ambition, in his street dress and manner of walking,
to give an exact personation of the character of Filch
in the Beggars’ Opera. Nisbet at that period dressed a
good deal above Filch, however he might resemble him in
gait. He had a coat edged all round with gold lace, wore
a gold watch on each side (an extravagant fashion then
prevalent), and with his cane, bag-wig, and gold-buckled
shoes, was really a fine figure of the pre-revolutionary era.
His house was in the Canongate—a good flat in Chessels’s
Court—garrisoned only by a female servant called Nanny.
Nisbet at length squandered away the whole of his estate,
and became a <em>victim</em>. All the world fell away from him;
but Nanny still remained. From the entailed family flat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
in Chessels’s Court, he had to remove to a den somewhere
about the Netherbow: Nanny went with him. Then
came the period of wretchedness: Nanny, however, still
stuck fast. The unfortunate gentleman could not himself
appear in his woe-begone attire upon those streets where
he had formerly shone a resplendent sun; neither could
he bring his well-born face to solicit his former friends for
subsidies. Nanny did all that was necessary. Foul day
and fair day, she was to be seen gliding about the streets,
either petitioning tradesmen for goods to her master on
credit, or collecting food and money from the houses of his
acquaintance. If a liquid alms was offered, she had a
white tankard, streaked with smoky-looking cracks, for its
reception; if the proffered article was a mass of flesh, she
had a plate or a towel. There never was such a forager.
Nisbet himself used to call her “true and trusty,” by way
of a compliment to her collective powers; and he finally
found so much reason to appreciate her disinterested attachment,
that, on reaching the usual fatal period of fifty, he
made her his wife! What was the catastrophe of their
story, I never heard.</p>

<p>The second, and only other instance of the <em>fag-victim</em>
which can be given here, is of a still more touching character
than the above, and seems to make it necessary for the
writer of this trifling essay to protest, beforehand, against
being thought a scoffer at the misery of his fellow creatures.
He begs it to be understood, that, however light be the
language in which he speaks, he hopes that he can look
with no other than respectful feelings upon human nature,
in a suffering, and, more especially, a self-denying form.</p>

<p>Some years ago, there flourished, in one of the principal
thoroughfares of Edinburgh, a fashionable perfumer, the inheritor
of an old business, and a man of respectable connections,
who, falling into dissolute habits, became of course
very much embarrassed, and, finally, “unfortunate.” In his
shop,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">a man, at the time of his master’s failure, advanced to nearly
middle life, but who, having never been any where else
since he was ten or twelve years of age, than behind Finlay’s
counter—Sundays and meal-hours alone excepted—was
still looked upon by his master as “the boy of the shop,” and
so styled accordingly. This worthy creature had, in the
course of time, become as a mere piece of furniture in the
shop; his soul had <em>fraternized</em> (to use a modern French
phrase) with his situation. The drawers and shottles, the
combs, brushes, and bottles, had entered into and become
part of his own existence; he took them all under the wide-spreading
boughs of his affections; they were to him, as the
infant to the mother, part of himself. He was on the best
terms with every thing about the shop; the handles of all
things were fitted to his hand; every thing came to him,
to use a proverbial expression of Scotland, like the bowl
of a pint-stoup. In fact, like a piece of wood placed in a
petrifying spring, this man might be said to have been transfigured
out of his original flesh and blood altogether, and
changed into a creature participating in the existence and
qualities of certain essences, perfumes, wigs, pomades,
drawers, wig-blocks, glass cases, and counters forming the
<em>materiel</em> of Mr Finlay’s establishment. Such a being was,
as may be supposed, a useful servant. He knew all the
customers; he knew his master’s whole form of practice,
all his habits, and every peculiarity of his temper. And
then the fidelity of the creature; but that was chiefly shown
in the latter evil days of the shop, and during the victimhood
of his master. As misfortune came on, the friendship
of master and man became more intensely familiar and intimate
than it had ever been before. As the proudest man,
met by a lion in the desert, makes no scruple to coalesce
with his servant in resisting it, so was Finlay induced, by
the devouring monster Poverty, to descend to the level,
and make a companion, of his faithful “boy.” They would
at last go to the same tavern together, take the same Sunday
walks—were, in reality, boon companions. In all Finlay’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
distresses, the “boy” partook; if any thing “occurred
about a bill,” as Crabbe says, it was the “boy” who had
the chief dolour of its accommodation; he would scour the
North and South Bridges, with his hat off, borrowing small
silver a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’improviste</i>, as if to make up change to a customer,
till he had the necessary sum amassed. The “boy” at
length became very much demoralised: he grew vicious
towards the world, to be the more splendidly virtuous to
his master: one grand redeeming quality, after the manner
of Moses’ serpent, had eaten up all the rest. It were needless
to pursue the history of the shop through all its stages
of declension. Through them all the “boy” survived,
unshaken in his attachment. The shop might fade, grow
dim, and die, but the “boy” never. The goods might
be diminished, the Duke of Wellington might be sold for
whisky, and his lady companions pawn their wigs for
mutton pies; but the “boy” was a fixture. There was
no pledging away his devoted, inextinguishable friendship.
The master at last <em>went to</em> the Canongate jail—I say <em>went
to</em>, in order to inform the sentimental part of mankind that
imprisonment is seldom done in the active voice, people
generally incarcerating themselves with the most philosophical
deliberation, and not the least air of compulsion in
the matter. The shop was still kept open, and the “boy”
attended it. But every evening did he repair to the dreary
mansion, to solace his master with the news of the day,
see after his comforts, and yield up the prey which, jackall-like,
he had collected during the preceding four-and-twenty
hours. This prey, be it remarked, was not raised from the
sale of any thing in the shop. Every saleable article had
by this time been sold. The only furniture was now a pair
of scissors and a comb, together with the announcement,
“Hair-cutting rooms,” in the window. By means of these
three things, however, the “boy” contrived generally to
<em>fleece</em> the public of a few sixpences in the day; and all these
sixpences, with the exception of a small commission for his
own meagre subsistence, went to his master at the Canongate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
jail. Often, in the hour between eight and nine in the
evening, have they sat in that small dingy back-room behind
the large hall, enjoying a bottle of strong ale, drunk
out of stoneware tumblers—talking over all their embarrassments,
and speculating how to get clear of them. Other
prisoners had their wives or their brothers to see after
them; but we question if any one had, even in these relations
of kindred, a friend so attached as the “boy.” At
length, after a certain period, this unfortunate tradesman
was one evening permitted to walk away, arm in arm, with
his faithful “young man,” and the world was all before
them where to choose.</p>

<p>For a considerable period all trace of the attached pair is
lost. No doubt their course was through many scenes of
poignant misery; for at the only part of their career upon
which I have happened to obtain any light, the “boy” was
wandering through the streets of Carlisle, in the dress and
appearance of a very old beggar, and singing the songs
wherewith he had formerly delighted the citizens of Edinburgh
in Mrs Manson’s or Johnnie Dowie’s, for the subsistence
of his master, who, as ascertained by my informant,
was deposited in a state of sickness and wretchedness transcending
all description, in a low lodging-house in a back
street. Such is the fag-victim, following his master</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FALLACIES_OF_THE_YOUNG2">FALLACIES OF THE YOUNG.<br>
<span class="fs80">“ACQUAINTANCES.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">One of the most important concerns of young people is,
the management of themselves in respect of what are called
“acquaintances.” To have many friends is desirable, in
a world where men are generally thrown so much upon
their own resources. But there is a distinction between
the friendship of a certain number of respectable persons,
who are only ready to exert themselves for us when called
upon, and the acquaintance of a circle of contemporaries,
who are perpetually forcing themselves upon our company
for the mere purpose of mutual amusement. Taking the
words in their usual signification, a young man ought to
wish for many friends, but few acquaintances. There is
something in the countenance of a companion that cheers
and supports the frailty of human nature. One can speak
and act more boldly with a friend by his side, than when
alone. But it is the good fortune of men of strong character,
and it ought to be the object of every one, to act
well and boldly by himself. One thing young people
may be assured of, almost all the great services which
enlightened men have done for their race, were performed
alone. There was but one man, not two, at the discovery
of the Compass, of the Copernican System, of the Logarithms,
and of the principle of Vaccination. To descend
to lesser things, ask any man who has risen in worldly fortune,
from small beginnings to great wealth and honour,
how he contrived to do so, and you will find that he carved
it all out for himself with his own hand. He will in all
probability inform you that he has reached the honourable
station in society which he now maintains, chiefly by narrowing
the circle of his “private acquaintances,” and extending
that of his “public relations,” most likely adding,
that had he on all occasions “consulted” the persons with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
whom he happened to be acquainted, as to his designs, he
would, by every calculation, have been still in the same
obscure insignificant situation he once was. The truth is,
it is only when alone that we have the ability to concentrate
our minds upon any object; and it is only when things
are done with the full force of <em>one mind</em> qualified for the
purpose, that they are done well.</p>

<p>It is the misfortune of young people, before they become
fully engaged in the relations of life and business, that they
look too much to “acquaintances” for encouragement, and
make the amusement which “acquaintances” can furnish
too indispensable. The tender mind of youth is reluctant,
or unable, to stand alone; it needs to be one of a class.
Hence, the hours which ought to be spent in the acquisition
of that general knowledge which is so useful in after
life, and which can only be acquired in the vacant days of
youth, are thrown away in the most inglorious pursuits; for
“acquaintances” are seldom the companions of study, or
the auxiliaries of business, but most generally the associates
of a debauch, the fellow-flutterers upon the Mall, the companion-hounds
in the chase of empty pleasure. It is amazing
how much a youth can endure of the company of his
principal “acquaintance.” Virgil’s expression, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tecum consumerer
ævo</i>,” is realised in his case; for he veritably appears
as if he could <em>spend his whole life</em> in the society of the
treasured individual. At the approach of that person, every
other matter is cast aside; the most important business
seems nothing in contrast with the interchange of a smile
or a jest with this duplicate of himself. The injunctions
of the most valued relations—even of father and mother—are
scattered to the winds, if they are at variance with the
counsels or conduct of this precious person, whom, after
all, he perhaps met only last week at a club. The power
of an “acquaintance” of this kind, for good or evil, over
the mind of his friend, is so very great, that it may well
give some concern to those who are really interested in the
prospects of youth. But every effort to redeem a victim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
from the fascination, will be in vain, unless his natural or
habitual goodness be shocked by the further exposure of
the “acquaintance’s” character. The only safeguard,
therefore, against this mighty evil, is, <em>previously</em> to accustom
youth to depend much upon themselves, and to endeavour
to infuse into them a sufficient degree of moral
excellence, to be a protection to them against the worst
vices which “acquaintances” may attempt to impart to
them.</p>

<p>There is a possibility, however, that the “acquaintance”
may be no worse than his fellow, and yet the two will do
that together which they could not do singly. Virtue is,
upon the whole, a thing of solitude: vice is a thing of the
crowd. The individual will not dare to be wicked, for the
responsibility which he knows must be concentrated upon
himself; while the company, feeling that a divided responsibility
is hardly any responsibility at all, is under no
such constraint. There is much edification to the heart
of the thoughtless and wicked in the participation of companions;
and even in large associations of honourable men
for honourable purposes, there is often wanting that fine
tone of feeling which governs the conduct of perhaps each
individual in the fraternity. Thus, an excessive indulgence
in the company of “acquaintances” is to be avoided, even
where these “acquaintances” are not inferior in moral
worth to ourselves. There is an easy kind of morality much
in vogue among a great body of people, that “what others
do we may do,” as if higher standards had not been handed
down by God himself from heaven, or constructed in the
course of time by the wise and pure among men. This
morality comes strongly into play among youth in their
intercourse with contemporaries; and as it is always on
rather a declining than an advancing scale, it soon leads
them a great way down the paths of vice.</p>

<p>It will be found, in general, that a considerable degree
of abstinence from this indulgence is required, even to
secure the most ordinary degree of success in life. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
if great things be aimed at, if we wish to surpass our fellows
by many degrees, and to render ourselves honourably
conspicuous among men, we must abjure “acquaintances”
almost entirely. We must, for that purpose, withdraw
ourselves from all temptation to idle and futile amusement—we
must, in the words of a great poet, “shun delights,
and live laborious days.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUBJECTS_OF_CONVERSATION">SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Subjects of conversation are sometimes exceedingly difficult
to be had. I have known many a company of well-dressed
men and women feel themselves most awkwardly
situated for want of something to talk about. The weather,
which is said to be a never-failing subject, cannot hold out
above a few minutes at a time. It will stand a round or
two rounds, but not more. It is then knocked up for the
evening, and cannot with decency be again brought forward.
Being thus disposed of, the subject of “news” is introduced;
but, as a matter of course, there being no “news
stirring,” “not a word,” “nothing in the papers,” that
subject is soon also dispatched. If there happen to be any
very remarkable occurrence worth talking of, what a blessing
it is on such occasions! It is food for the company a
whole night, and may be again and again brought above
board for their amusement. But it much more frequently
happens that there is no exciting event to talk about, and
then the condition of the company is truly miserable.
There being ladies present, or there being two factions in
the room, politics are proscribed. Every attempt at getting
up a topic failing, the company look into the fire, or
in each other’s faces, or begin to examine with much interest
the pattern of the carpet; and the silence which ensues
is truly terrific. A slight whisper is the only sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
in the apartment, and is caught at or watched by the company,
for it may chance to be the commencement of a
conversation in which they may join, without exciting
particular attention. But it, too, dies away. It was only
a passing under-current of remark between the two married
ladies in the blue and white turbans, on the dearth of coals,
the difficulty of getting good servants, or the utility of
keeping children muffled in flannel nightgowns from October
till March. At length some good soul makes an effort
to brush away his diffidence. He projects a remark across
the room towards the little man with the smirking countenance,
about Mr This or Miss That, or Signor Such-a-thing,
who are at present enlivening the town with their exhibitions.
The remark is in itself a very ordinary remark, but
it has its use: it quickens the intellects of those who hear
it, and the tongues of a number of individuals are set a-going
upon the subject of theatrical amusements, singing in
the Assembly Rooms, Pasta, Paganini, and private parties,
so that the original remark is lost sight of, and the
company go on pretty well with what it has produced for
perhaps half an hour. All these topics being exhausted,
another horrible silence ensues. The company again look
into the fire, or in one another’s faces, and once more examine
the carpet. What <em>is</em> to be said next? All think
upon saying something, yet nobody speaks. The national
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</i> is now displayed to the height of its perfection.
The agony of the company, however, approaches its
crisis. The awful stillness is broken, and in a most natural
and unexpected manner. The young man in the starched
cravat sitting in a corner of the room, near the end of the
piano, who has been thinking what he should say or do for
the last half hour, takes heart of grace; he rises and snuffs
the candles, going through the self-imposed duty in as neat
and elegant a style as he can possibly affect. The snuffing
of the candles is an operation which every member of the
company has seen performed ten thousand times; but it affords
interest for even the ten thousandth and first time. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
may not intrinsically be worth heeding, yet, in a case of this
nature, it is of very great importance. It suggests a new
theme, and that is exactly what was wanted, for one subject
invariably leads to the discussion of half a dozen others.
The operation of snuffing the candles, therefore, induces
some one to remark, how beautiful gas-light is. Then this
brings on a disquisition on the danger of introducing it into
private houses; its cost in comparison with oil is next
touched upon; then follows an observation about the last
illumination; which leads to reminiscences of similar displays
on the occasions of the great naval victories—the
victories lead to Nelson—Nelson to his biographer, Southey—Southey
to poetry—poetry to Byron—and Byron to
Greece. This whirl of conversation, however, also runs
out; an accident jars it, and it is all over. Suddenly the
speakers pause, as if they had received a galvanic shock;
one small voice is alone left prominent above the silence;
but finding itself unsupported, it is immediately lowered to
a whisper, and the whisper subsides to a dead silence.</p>

<p>I have often pitied the host or hostess on occasions of
this nature, but I could not help blaming them for not
providing against such dismal pauses in the conversation
of their parties. To guard against these occurrences, I
would recommend them to bring forward what I have
remarked to be never-failing sources of conversational
entertainment, namely, a tolerably good-looking cat, a
lapdog, or a child. The last is the best. It ought to be
about two years of age, and be able to walk. If adroitly
played off, or permitted to play, it will amuse the party for
an hour at least. It must be placed on the hearth-rug, so
as to attract all eyes; and while in the room, no other subject
will be thought of. Any endeavour to draw off attention,
by the relation of some entertaining anecdote, will be
deemed sedition against the majesty of the household. If
a cat, a dog, or an interesting child, cannot be conveniently
had, I would advise the invitation of some one who has a
loud voice, and the happy effrontery of speaking incessantly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
however ridiculously, on all subjects,—a person who can
speak nonsense to any extent, and has the reputation of
being a most agreeable companion. This man is of vast
use in introducing subjects; for he has no diffidence or
modesty, and has a knack of turning every observation to
account. His voice also serves as a cover to much by
conversation; there being hundreds who would speak fluently
enough, provided a bagpipe were kept playing beside
them, or who could have their voices drowned by some
other species of noise. The loud and voluble talker is
therefore an excellent shelter for those of weaker nerves,
and will be found a useful ingredient in all mixed companies.</p>

<p>The difficulty of starting subjects of conversation, as
well as the difficulty of sustaining them, is often as observable
when two acquaintances meet on the street, as when
a roomful of company is collected. The unhappy pair exhaust
all that they can remember they ought to say to each
other in the space of a minute and a half, and another minute
may be consumed in going through the process of
taking a pinch of snuff; the next half minute is spent in
mutual agony. Neither knows how to separate. As the
only chance of release, one of the parties at last brings in
a joke, or what is meant to be such, to his aid. The
other, of course, feels bound to laugh, and both seizing
the opportunity, escape in different directions under cover
of the witticism.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Oh, he’s a sicker ane!” is a phrase used in Scotland in
reference to that class of people who make excessively sure
about every thing, and are in no manner of means to be
imposed upon. I style such persons Secure Ones, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to be intelligible to southern as well as northern readers.
Every body must know a certain class of secure ones by
the timid cautiousness and exactness of their behaviour;
by the trim, unostentatious propriety of their external aspect.
There is a lambs’-woollery comfort and a broad-cloth
completeness about this sort of secure one, that
nobody can mistake; he even seems to have made the
number of buttons in his vest, and the height to which that
garment is buttoned up, a matter of accurate calculation.
He could not go abroad under less than a certain press
of flannel and great-coat for the world; and you might almost
as soon expect to meet him without his left arm as
minus the silk umbrella under it. (He carries the latter
part of himself, or fifth limb, at an angle of about sixty degrees
to the horizon, the handle down behind, and the
point forked up in front.) When he observes any part of
the pavement railed off, in order to save the passengers all
danger from an occasional pelleting of stones and bits of
plaster which the slaters or chimney-doctors are producing
from above, he deploys into the street a good way before
coming up to the actual rail or rope, and, in passing, takes
care to sweep several good yards beyond the utmost range
of shot. “Don’t like these things coming peppering down
that way; might almost dislocate one’s shoulder if they
were to fall upon it; perhaps we had better go over to the
other side of the street altogether. No need, you know,
for running into unnecessary danger.” When a secure
one ascends a stair, he goes step after step monotonously
on, performing every move of his feet with a sound, conscientious
deliberation, and seems determined upon doing
full justice to every landing-place. He holds firmly, however
unnecessarily, by the baluster, since the baluster is
there, and he has an obvious satisfaction in the slight pant
which he thinks himself entitled to get up on the occasion.
The secure one always shuts a door carefully behind him.
He takes off his hat softly, with a regard at once to the
smooth economy of his hair, and the pile of his chapeau.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
He has a maxim that the hat should be first raised and
loosened from behind, where it slides up along the glossy
hair, not from the front, where it encounters a comparative
obstruction from the fleshy brow. He lays down his
gloves neatly on the top of each other, and hangs up his
hat with an air of carefulness truly exemplary. The secure
one is a bit of an epicure. When out in the forenoon,
he would not for any consideration take lunch or
wine. “Madam, would you have me spoil my appetite for
dinner?” This appetite he nurses and cherishes in the
course of his saunterings between two and five, as carefully
as a miser doting over his heap. He holds a telegraphic
communion with his inner man that passeth show;
he coquets and dallies with his stomach; every indescribable
symptom is taken into account, and forms the subject
of unexpressed congratulation. “Dear tender flowers of
appetite, it would be sacrilege, or worse, to nip ye in the
bud, by powdering over you the baneful dew of a glass of
Bucellas, or the still more odious blight of a basin of mulligatawny.
No, I will coax you, and protect you, and <em>travel</em>
for you, in faithful love and kindness, even until ye shall
be fully fattened up for slaughter at five o’clock.” When
the secure one sits down to table, he painsfully and not
unostentatiously (to himself) relieves the one lowest button
of his vest from the thrall of button-hole, and with
equally deliberate care arranges a napkin over the front of
his person. Dinner is a sacred ceremony, and requires its
canonicals. Being fully acquainted with the whole planisphere
of the table, he takes an exactly proportioned quantity
of each article, so as ultimately to have enjoyed each
in its exact proportion of merit, and to have precisely
enough out of the whole. A secure one is frequently an
old respectable unmarried gentleman, residing with a single
servant—Jenny—in a “self-contained” house about
Stockbridge or Newington. Knowing the distance at
which he lives from the mercantile parts of the town, he
takes care never to want what he calls a pound of change,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
as well as a small stock of copper—at least the value of a
shilling—observing also that the change is not unmixed
with sixpences, so that when any shopkeeper’s boy calls
for payment of an account, or to take back the purchase-money
of any article he has bought that day in town, he
may not have to trouble [<em>i. e.</em> trust] the messenger with
the duty of obtaining change for a bank note, which would
tend to occasion a more than necessary answering of the
bells at the door, besides keeping him in an agony of fiddle-faddle
till the little affair was settled. Jenny, who has been
so long in his service as to have become almost as secure
as himself, never opens the door o’ nights without putting
on the chain; and she has a standing order against all parleying
with beggars, or poor women who sell tapes and
such things out of baskets. The secure one regards few
creatures in this world with a more jealous or malignant
eye than these personages. “Why, Sir, they want nothing
but to make an opportunity of stripping the lobby or
the kitchen!” And such a story he can tell of a missing
hat-brush! “A woman seen that morning going about—sold
a pair of garters to the maid-servant three doors off at
ten—front door had been left open for a minute, not more,
while Jenny ran after me with something I had forgot—and
in that time—it could have been at no other—the deed
was done. A hat-brush I had just got with my last hat
at Grieve and Scott’s; had a thing that screwed in at the
one end, so that it was a stretcher also; cost four and sixpence,
even taking the hat along with it.” And the secure
one, without any premeditated hard-heartedness,
thinks nothing of making such an incident apologize to
himself for an habitual shutting of his door and his heart
against the poor for the next twelvemonth. There is never
any imperfection in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">externe</i> of the secure one. He
bears about him a certain integrality of look that fills and
satisfies the eye. From his good well-brushed waterproof
beaver, all along down by his roomy blue coat, drab well-fledged,
amply-trousered limbs, and so down to his <em>double</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
shoes, not omitting such points as his voluminous white
neckcloth without collar, his large Cairngorm brooch,
which looks as if a dish of jelly had been inverted into his
bosom, and his heavy, pursy bunch of seals dangling, clearly
defined and well relieved, from the precipice of belly—every
thing betokens the secure one. Clothes are not so much
clothes with him as they are a kind of defensive armour!
The truth is, the secure one lives in a state of constant
warfare with the skiey influences. The chief campaign is
in winter. Instead of entering the field, like Captain
Bobadil, about the tenth of March, he opens the trenches
towards the twenty-fourth of October. He then invests
himself with a cuirass of wool almost thick enough to obstruct
the passage of a cannon-ball. For months after, he
remains in arms, prepared to stand out against the most
violent attacks of the enemy, and, in reality, there is hardly
any advantage to be got of the secure one by fair open
storms or frosts. He bears a charmed life against all such
candid modes of warfare. He cannot be overthrown in a
pitched battle. It is only ambuscade draughts through
open windows, and other kinds of bush-fighting, that ever
are of any effect against him. Like Hector in the armour
of Patroclus, he is invulnerable over almost all his whole
person; but an arrowy rheumatism, like the spear of
Achilles, will sometimes reach him through a very small
chink. Like the mighty Achilles himself, he is literally
proof, perhaps, against every thing but what assails him
through the very lowest part of his person—he can stand
every thing but wet feet. There is an instance on record
of his having once been laid by the heels for three months,
in consequence of sitting one night in the pit of the Theatre
with a slightly damp umbrella between his knees. He was
just about to get entirely better of this disorder, when all
at once he was thrown back for six weeks more, by reason,
as he himself related, of his having changed the wear (in
his sick-chamber) of a silk watch-riband for a chain!
“All from the imprudence of that rash girl Jenny, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
thought the riband a little shabby, and put on the chain
instead. Why, Sir! a thick double riband, more than an
inch broad; only conceive what a material addition it must
have been to my ordinary clothing!” The chain, he might
have added, was apt to be worse than nothing, for it was
of irregular application, tattooing his person, as it were,
with a minutely decussated exposure, so that the cold was
likely to have struck him as with the teeth of a comb!
The secure one has an anxiety peculiar to himself on the
subject of easy-chairs, nightgowns, and slippers. The
easy-chair must be exact in angle to a single minute of a
degree; the nightgown must be properly seen to in respect
of fur and flannel; the slippers must every night be placed
for him at the proper place; and if Jenny has been so inattentive
as to place the left one on the right of the other,
he feels himself not a little discomposed. The secure one
is most pestilently and piquantly accurate about all things.
He loves to arrange, and arrange, and arrange, and over
again arrange and settle all the preliminaries and pertinents
of any little matter which cannot reasonably be done but
one way. If he wishes, for instance, to confer with an
upholsterer respecting some alteration in the above easy-chair,
he first calls one forenoon, and inflicts an hour’s explanation
upon the unhappy man of wood—who is not all
a man of wood, otherwise he would, in such a case, be
happy. It does not in the least matter at what hour the
tradesman should come to see this chair, for the secure
one is to be at home the whole day. Yet the very liberty
at which he stands produces a difficulty. It would be
charity in Providence, by any interference, “to give him
not to choose.” “Say eleven; I shall then be quite disengaged—will
that hour suit you? Or make it any other
hour—say twelve—or say half-past eleven—half-past would
do very well.” [He recollects that he seldom gets the
whole fiddle-faddle of feeding the canaries over by <em>half-past</em>.]
“Suppose it were a quarter to twelve; that would
answer me better still. I may, perhaps, take a walk out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
at mid-day; would a quarter to twelve do? Or I might
hurry the canaries, and then the half-past might do. I
dare say half-past will do best after all; mind half-past
eleven,” &amp;c. &amp;c. The man comes, and the business of the
chair is entered into. The whole affair is most amply canvassed.
The secure one sits down in it, and gives a lecture
in a very <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-cathedra</i> style upon all its properties and
defects. He complains of the back reclining a little too
much back, or the bottom showing too little bottom, or some
other fault equally inappreciable; and the upholsterer sees
at once that the secure one only complains of this, as he
is apt to do of other things, for the very uneasiness arising
from its over-easiness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lulled on the rack of a too-easy chair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fact is, the secure one has brought every appliance
of life to such an absolute exactitude and perfection,
that, having no longer any thing to give him pain, he becomes
quite wretched. Secureness, it is evident, may go
too far. We may become actually frightened in this world
at our own caution. We may be shocked by the very unimpeachability
of our own virtue. We may become miserable
through the extremity of our happiness. In the same
manner the secure one, when he has “got all things
right,” as he would say, finds himself, to his great disappointment,
just at the threshold of woe and evil. He has
exactly got time to set his house in order, before the proper
consequence of such an event befalls him; and he expires
at the very moment when he has just completed his preparations
to live.</p>

<p>There is another order of secure ones, whose carefulness
refers rather to their wealth than their health. There
is an awful inviolability of pocket about such men—a provoking
guardedness against all the possible appeals of friendship,
and all the impulses of benevolence. Such men look
as if they were all stanchioned over. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Pucelle</i> itself
was not more perfectly fortified than their breeches. A
poorer man is apt to feel in their presence as if he were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
under an indictment for an intention either to beg or borrow,
or, perhaps, to steal from them. He sees something criminative
against himself in every impregnable-looking button.
Secure ones of this class, perhaps, are bachelors under forty—careful,
circumspect men, that have passed through the
ordeal of a thousand evening parties without ever being in
the least danger. They abstain from marrying, from very fear
lest any advantage should be got of them. They cannot
enter into the slightest intercourse with a young lady, without
letting it appear that they are perfectly on their guard.
The most undesigning girl, like the above poor man, feels
in their presence as if she were liable to be construed into
an absolute “drapery miss.” He is always quite civil, but
that is from his very <em>secureness</em>: he knows he is in no danger.
An experienced woman gives up a man of this kind at first
sight. She sees he is cook’s meat, <em>i. e.</em> that he is to marry a
middle-aged kitchen woman at fifty, upon the ground of her
proficiency in preparing a beef-steak. The general feeling
of the sex regarding this sort of secure one is, “Confound
the fellow! does he think that any one cares for him, or
would take him though he were willing?”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nobody wants you, Sir, she said.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The secure one, however, does not appear ever to
suppose that the ladies have a veto in proposals of marriage.
He looks upon them all as a class so eager on
capturing and entrapping men, that it never enters into his
head that there is such a thing as a rejected offer. The
man he considers to be the passive and accepting party;
the lady is the besieging enemy, and he is the fortress;
the marriage takes place only if <em>he</em> chooses. It may be
supposed, then, what would be the state of a secure
one’s mind, if he were to relent some fine day in a fit of
generosity (a thing only to be supposed in the event of
his becoming <em>fey</em>), and in a liberal, candid, honourable manner,
offer his hand to a young lady of little fortune, whom
he was disposed to think suitable on the score of personal
merit alone, but who having some prior attachment to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
man one-half as old, and twice as generous, was under the
necessity of only thanking him for the honour. The cook
or any thing after that! And how the whole sex would
rejoice in his calamity!! “A fellow, forsooth, that has
been a living insult to the tribe of womankind all his days.
He is well served.”</p>

<p>There is another kind of secure one, considerably different
in circumstances from the above—a married man
about sixty, with a large family, in which there are several
grown daughters. These girls are constantly under his
eye. At church he puts them into a pew, and sits down
at the door himself, as if he were a kind of serpent guarding
the Hesperian fruit. To the eyes of hundreds of young
men under twenty, who are not yet considered to be sufficiently
settled in the world to marry, these young ladies
seem unapproachable as the top of the steeple. They look
as if they were absolutely walled round with jealous and
<em>secure</em> paternity. One after another they are taken off by
middle-aged cousins and other distant relations, about whose
“respectability” there can be no doubt; and the young
men in the back pew sigh to see that the family is determined
upon being self-contained. For it is one of those
families, perhaps, who enjoy the credit of a great deal of
vague, and not very strictly apportioned wealth, under the
clause, “There’s plenty o’ siller amang them;” and who
seem as if they would consider the admission of a stranger
into the circle as a thing of some danger, however “respectable”
he might appear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORY_OF_MRS_MACFARLANE">STORY OF MRS MACFARLANE.</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>——“Let them say I am romantic—so is every one said to be, that
either admires a fine thing or does one. On my conscience, as the world
goes, ’tis hardly worth any body’s while to do one for the honour of it.
Glory, the only pay of generous actions, is now as ill paid as other great
debts; and neither Mrs Macfarlane, for immolating her lover, nor you for
constancy to your lord, must ever hope to be compared to Lucretia or
Portia.”—<em>Pope, to Lady M. W. Montague.</em></p>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">It was formerly the fashion in Scotland for every father of
a family to take all the people under his care along with him
to church, leaving the house locked up till his return. No
servant was left to cook the dinner, for it was then judged
improper to take a dinner which required cooking. Neither,
except in the case of a mere suckling, was it considered necessary
to leave any of the children; every brat about the
house was taken to church also; if they did not understand
what was said by the minister, they at least did not prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the attendance of those who did; and moreover—and this
was always a great consideration—they were out of harm’s
way. One Sunday, in autumn 1719, Sir John Swinton of
Swinton, in Berwickshire, was obliged to omit his little
daughter Margaret from the flock which usually followed
him to church. The child was indisposed with some trifling
ailment, which, however, only rendered it necessary that she
should keep her room. It was not considered requisite that
a servant should be left behind to take charge of her, for she
was too sagacious a child to require any such guardianship;
and Sir John and Lady Swinton naturally grudged, with the
scruples of the age, that the devotions of any adult member
of their household should be prevented on such an account.
The child, then, was left by herself in one of the upper bed-rooms
of the old baronial mansion of Swinton, no other
measure being taken for her protection than that of locking
the outer door.</p>

<p>For a girl of ten years of age, Margaret Swinton was possessed
of much good sense and solidity of character. She
heard herself doomed to a solitary confinement of six hours
without shrinking; or thought, at least, that she would have
no difficulty in beguiling the time by means of her new book—the
Pilgrim’s Progress. So long as the steps and voices
of her kindred were heard about the house, she felt quite at
her ease. But, in reality, the trial was too severe for the
nerves of a child of her tender age. When she heard the
outer door locked by the last person that left the house, she
felt the sound as a knell. The shot of the bolt echoed
through the long passages of the empty house with a supernatural
loudness; and, next moment after, succeeded that
perceptible audible quiet, the breath-like voice of an untenanted
mansion, which, like the hum of the vacant shell,
seems still as if it were charged with sounds of life. There
was no serious occasion for fear, seeing that nothing like real
danger could be apprehended; nor was this the proper time
for the appearance of supernatural beings: yet the very
loneliness of her situation, and the speaking stillness of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
around her, insensibly overspread her mind with that vague
negative sensation which is described by the native word
<em>eeriness</em>. From her window nothing was visible but the
cold blue sky, which was not enlivened by even the occasional
transit of a cloud. By and by the desolating wind
of autumn began to break upon the moody silence of the
hour. It rose in low melancholy gusts, and, whistling monotonously
through every chink, spoke to the mind of this
little child, of withering woods, and the lengthened excursions
of hosts of leaves, hurried on from the scene of their
summer pride into the dens and hollows where they were to
decay. The sound gradually became more fitful and impetuous,
and at last appeared to her imagination as if it
were the voice of an enemy who was running round and
round the house, in quest of admission—now and then
going away as if disappointed and foiled, and anon returning
to the attack, and breathing his rage and vexation in at every
aperture. She soon found her mind possessed by a numerous
train of fantastic fancies and fearful associations, drawn
from the store of nursery legends and ballads which she was
in the habit of hearing night after night, at the fireside in
the hall, and which were infinitely more dreadful than the
refined superstitions of modern children. She thought of
the black bull of Norway, which went about the world destroying
whatever of human life came within its reach; of
the weary well at the World’s End, which formed the
entrance into new regions, from whence no traveller ever
returned; and of the fairies or <em>good neighbours</em>, a small
green-coated race of supernatural creatures, who often
came to the dwellings of mortals, and did them many good
and evil turns. She had been told of persons yet alive,
who in their childhood had been led away by these fays
into the woods, and fed for weeks with wild berries and the
milk of nuts, till at length, by the <em>po’orfu’</em> preaching of some
great country divine, they were reclaimed to their parents,
being in such cases generally found sitting under a tree near
their own homes. She had heard of a queen of these people—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Queen of Elfinland—who occasionally took a fancy
for fair young maidens, and endeavoured to wile them into
her service; and the thought occurred to her, that, as the
fairies could enter through the smallest aperture, the house
might be full of them at this moment.</p>

<p>For several hours the poor child suffered under these
varied apprehensions, till at last she became in some measure
desperate, and resolved at least to remove to another
part of the house. The parlour below stairs commanded
from its window a view of the avenue by which the house
was approached; and she conceived that, by planting herself
in the embrasure of one of those windows, she would
be at the very border of the <em>eerie</em> region within doors, and
as near as possible to the scene without, the familiarity of
which was in itself calculated to dispel her fears. From
that point, also, she would catch the first glimpse of the
family returning from church, after which she would no
longer be in solitude. Trying, therefore, to think of a
merry border tune, she opened her own door, walked along
the passage—making as much noise as she could—and
tramped sturdily and distinctly down stairs. The room of
which she intended to take possession was at the end of
a long passage leading from the back to the front of the
house. This she traversed slowly—not without fear of
being caught from behind by some unimaginable creature
of horror; an idea which, on her reaching the chamber
door, so far operated upon her, that, yielding to her imaginary
terrors, and yet relying for safety upon getting into
the parlour, she in the same moment uttered a slight scream
and burst half joyfully into the room. Both of these actions
scarcely took up more than the space of a single
moment, and in another instant she had the door closed
and bolted behind her. But what was her astonishment,
her terror, and her awe, when, on glancing round the room,
she saw distinctly before her, and relieved against the light
of the window, the figure of a lady, in splendid apparel,
supernaturally tall, and upon whose countenance was depicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
a surprise not less than her own! The girl stood
fixed to the spot, her breath suspended, and her eyes wide
open, surveying the glorious apparition, whose beauty and
fine attire, unlike aught earthly she had ever seen, made
her believe it to be an <em>enchanted queen</em>—an imaginary being,
of which the idea was suggested to her by one of the
nursery tales already alluded to. Fortunately, the associations
connected with this personage were rather of a
pathetic than an alarming character; and though she still
trembled at the idea of being in the presence of a supernatural
object, yet as it was essentially beautiful and pleasing,
and supposed to be rather in a condition of suffering than
in the capacity of an injurer, Margaret Swinton did not
experience the extremity of terror, but stood for a few
seconds in innocent surprise, till at length the vision completely
assured her of its gentle and pacific character, by
smiling upon her, and, in a tone of the most winning sweetness,
bidding her approach. She then went forward,
with timid and slow steps; and becoming convinced that
her enchanted queen was neither more nor less than a real
lady of this world, soon ceased to regard her with any other
sentiment than that of admiration. The lady took her
hand, and addressed her by name—at first asking a few
unimportant questions, and concluding by telling her that
she might speak to her mother of what she had seen, but
by no means to say a word upon the subject to any other
person, and that under pain of her mother’s certain and severe
displeasure. Margaret promised to obey this injunction,
and was then desired by the lady to go to the window,
to see if the family were yet returning from church. She
did so, and found that they were not as yet in sight; when,
turning round to give that information to the stranger, she
found the room empty, and the lady gone. Her fears then
returned in full force, and she would certainly have fainted,
if she had not been all at once relieved by the appearance
of the family at the head of the avenue, along which the
dogs—as regular church-goers as their master—ran barking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
towards the house, gratifying her with what she afterwards
declared to have been the most welcome sounds that ever
saluted her ear.</p>

<p>Miss Swinton, being found out of her own room, was
sharply reprimanded by her mother, and taken up stairs to
be again confined to the sick-chamber. But before being
left there, she found an opportunity of whispering into her
mother’s ear, that she had seen a lady in the low parlour.
Lady Swinton was arrested by the words, and, immediately
dismissing the servant, asked Margaret, in a kindly and confidential
tone, what she meant. The child repeated, that
in the low parlour she had seen a beautiful lady—an enchanted
queen—who had afterwards vanished, but not before
having exacted from her a promise that she would say nothing
of what she had seen, except to her mother. “Margaret,”
said Lady Swinton, “I see you have been a very
good girl; and since you are so prudent, I will let you know
a little more about this enchanted queen, though her whole
story cannot properly be disclosed to you at present.” She
then conducted Margaret back to the parlour, pushed aside
a sliding panel, and entered a secret chamber, in which
the child again saw the tall and beautiful woman, who was
now sitting at a table with a large prayer-book open before
her. Lady Swinton informed the stranger, that, as Margaret
had kept her secret so far according to her desire,
she now brought her to learn more of it. “My dear,”
said her ladyship, “this lady is unfortunate—her life is
sought by certain men; and if you were to tell any of your
companions that you have seen her, it might perhaps be
the cause of bringing her to a violent death. You could
not wish that the enchanted queen should suffer from so
silly an error on your part.” Margaret protested, with
tears, that she would speak to none of what she had seen;
and after some farther conversation, she and her mother
retired.</p>

<p>Margaret Swinton never again saw this apparition; but
some years afterwards, when she had grown up, and all fears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
respecting the unfortunate lady were at an end, she learned
the particulars of her story. She was the Mrs Macfarlane
alluded to in the motto to this paper; a person whose fatal
history made a noise at the time over all Britain, and interested
alike the intelligent and the ignorant, the noble and
the mean.</p>

<p>Mrs Macfarlane was the only daughter of a gentleman
of Roxburghshire, who had perished in the insurrection of
1715. An attempt was made by his surviving friends to
save the estate from forfeiture, so that it might have been
enjoyed by his orphan daughter, then just emerged into womanhood.
But almost all hope of that consummation was
soon closed, and, in the meantime, the unfortunate young
lady remained in a destitute situation. The only arrangement
that could be devised by the generosity of her friends,
was to permit her to reside periodically for a certain time
in each of their houses—a mode of subsistence from which
her spirit recoiled, but to which, for a little while, she was
obliged to submit. It was while experiencing all the bitter
pangs of a dependent situation, encountered for the first
time, and altogether unexpectedly, that Mr Macfarlane, a
respectable and elderly law agent, who had been employed
by her father, came forward and made an offer of his hand.
Glad to escape from the immediate pain of dependency,
even at the hazard of permanent unhappiness, she accepted
the proposal, although her relations did every thing they
could to dissuade her from a match so much beneath her
rank. The proud spirit of Elizabeth Ker swelled almost
to bursting, when she entered the dwelling of her low-born
husband; and the humble marriage-feast which was there
placed before her, seemed in her eyes as the first wages of
her degradation. But her own reflections might have been
endured, and in time subdued, if they had not been kept
awake by the ungenerous treatment which she received from
all her former friends. The pride of caste was at this period
unbroken in Scotland, and it rigorously demanded the exclusion
of “the doer’s wife” from all the circles in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
she had previously moved. The stars made a conspiracy
to banish the sun. If Mrs Macfarlane had been educated
properly, she would have been able to repel scorn with
scorn, and, in these tergiversations of the narrow-spirited
great, would have only seen their degradation, not her
own. But under her deceased mother, a scion of a better
house than even her father’s, she had grown up in the full
participation of all the ridiculous notions as to caste, and
of course was herself deeply sensible of the advantages she
had forfeited. Rendered irritable in the highest degree by
consciousness of her own loss, she received every slight
thrown upon her by society into her innermost heart,
where it festered and fed upon her very vitals. She found
that she had fallen, that the step was irretrievable; and
as factitious degradation, imposed by the forms of society,
always in a short time becomes real, her character suffered
a material deterioration. She took refuge from offended
self-love in a spirit of hatred and contempt for her fellow-matrons,
and began to entertain feelings from which, in
earlier and happier years, she would have shrunk as from
actual crime.</p>

<p>There was at least one branch of the better sort of Edinburgh
society which never manifested any disinclination to
her acquaintance. This was the class of loose young men
of good birth, who daily paraded at the Cross with flowing
periwigs and glancing canes, and nightly drowned their senses
in a vulgar debauch, from which they occasionally awoke
in the morning with the duty of settling scores by a rencontre
in St Ann’s Yards, or at St Leonard’s Crags. This set
of brawlers, the proper successors of those drunken cavaliers
who disgraced a preceding age, subsisted in a state of pure
antagonism to the stayed and decorous habits of the general
community; many of them were literally the children
of cavaliers, and indebted in a great measure for their idle
way of life to the circumstances of the government, which
dictated an exclusive distribution of its patronage among
its own adherents, and of course left the poor Jacobites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
exposed to all the temptations of idleness. Dicing and
golfing were the employments of their forenoons; in the
evening they would stagger from table into Heriot’s Green,
or Lady Murray’s garden in the Canongate, where they
would make a point of staring out of countenance such
sober citizens and their daughters as ventured to frequent
those fashionable promenades. According to a Presbyterian
writer of the day, they sent to London regularly for
the last fashions and the newest oaths; but perhaps the
latter part of the report is only a scandal. If such personages
were to revive now-a-days, and appear some forenoon
among the modern <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> of Prince’s Street,
they would be looked upon, with their long wide-skirted
coats, and buckles, and cravats, as a set of the most solemn
looking gentlemen; but in their own time, there were
no ideas associated with them but those of reckless, hot-headed
youth, and daily habits the most opposite to those
of decency and virtue.</p>

<p>Mrs Macfarlane, while she sunk from the society of
gentlewomen of her own rank, still retained such acquaintance
as she had ever happened to possess, of their wild
sons and brothers. With them, she was in her turn an
object of great interest, on account of her transcendant
beauty, or rather its fame—for the fame with such persons
is of far more importance than the reality. It was
not disagreeable to Mrs Macfarlane, when she walked
with her husband on the Castle Hill, and found herself
passed with dry recognition by persons of her own sex, to
be made up to by some long-waisted Sir Harry Wildair,
who, in language borrowed from Congreve or Farquhar,
protested that the sun was much aided in his efforts to
illuminate the world by the light of her eyes. A rattle of
the fan was the least favour that could be dispensed in reward
for such a compliment; and then would ensue a conversation,
perhaps only interrupted by a declaration from
Mr Macfarlane, that he felt the air getting rather cold, and
was afraid to stay out any longer on account of his rheumatism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
The society of these fops was never farther encouraged
by Mrs Macfarlane; indeed, it was only agreeable
to her in public places, where it consoled her a little for
the ungenerous slights of more respectable persons. Yet
it had some effect upon her reputation, and was partly the
cause of all her misfortunes.</p>

<p>About two years after the insurrection of 1715, the host
of Edinburgh fops received an important accession in Mr
George Cayley, a young English gentleman, who was sent
down as one of the commissioners upon the forfeited estates.
Cayley brought with him a considerable stock of cash, an
oath of recent coinage, said to be very fashionable in Pall
Mall, and a vest of peculiar cut, which he had lately got
copied at Paris from an original belonging to the Regent
Orleans. As he also brought a full complement of the most
dissolute personal habits, he might be considered as recommended
in the strongest manner to the friendship of the
native beaux; if, indeed, his accomplishments were not apt
rather to produce displeasure from their superiority. Some
days after his arrival, he was introduced to Mrs Macfarlane,
to whom he was an object of some interest on account of
his concern in the disposal of her father’s estate. If she felt
an interest in him on this account, he was not the less struck
by her surpassing beauty and elegant manners, which appeared
to him alike thrown away upon her husband, and
the city in which she dwelt. He rushed home from the
first interview in a state of mind scarcely to be imagined.
That such a glorious creature should squander her light
upon the humble house of an attorney, when she seemed
equally fit to illuminate the halls of a palace, was in his
eyes a perversion of the designs of nature. He wished
that it was in his power to fly with her away—away from
all the scenes where either was known, to some place far
over this world’s wilderness, where every consciousness
might be lost, except that of mutual love. Over and over
again he deplored the artificial bonds imposed by human
laws, and protected by the virtuous part of the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
race, by which hearts the most devoted to each other were
often condemned to eternal separation. His heart, he
found, was possessed by sensations such as had never before
moved it. It worshipped its object as a kind of idol,
instead of, as formerly, regarding it as a toy. He flung
himself in idea before the shrine of her splendour, in breathless,
boundless, despairing passion.</p>

<p>It is probable that if Cayley had been fortunate enough
to meet Mrs Macfarlane before she was married, he might
have been inspired with an attachment equally devoted,
and which, being indulged innocently, might have had the
effect of purifying him from all his degrading vices, and
raising him into a worthy member of society. As it was,
the passion which, in proper circumstances, is apt to refine
and humanise, only lent a frantic earnestness to his
usual folly. He made it his endeavour to obtain as much
of her society as possible—an object in which he was greatly
favoured by his official character, which caused him to
be treated with much less coolness by Mr Macfarlane than
was otherwise to have been expected. That individual
had not altogether lost hope of regaining the property to
which his wife was entitled, and he therefore met Mr Cayley’s
advances with more than corresponding warmth, every
other sentiment being for the time subordinate to this important
object. The young Englishman, in order to cultivate
this delightful intimacy with the greater convenience,
removed from his former lodgings to a house directly opposite
to Mrs Macfarlane’s, in the High Street, where, at
such times as a visit was out of the question, he would sit
for hours watching patiently for the slightest glimpse of her
through the windows, and judging even a momentary gleam of
her figure within the dim glass as an ample compensation for
his pains. He now became much less lively than before—forsook,
in some measure, the company of his gay contemporaries—and
seemed, in short, the complete <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</i>
of the melancholy, abstracted lover. It was his custom to
spend most of his evenings in Mrs Macfarlane’s house; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
except during those too quickly flying hours, time was to him
the greatest misery. Existence was only existence in that
loved presence; the rest was a state of dormancy or watchfulness
only to be spent in pain. If he applied at all to
the business for which he was commissioned by the government,
it was only to that part of it which related to the
inheritance of Mrs Macfarlane, in order that he might every
night have an excuse for calling upon that lady, to inform
her of the progress he was making in her cause. His attachment
in that quarter was soon whispered abroad in
society; and while it served as a grateful theme for the
tongues of Mrs Macfarlane’s former compeers, the favour
with which he seemed to be received was equally the subject
of envy to the young men, few of whom had ever found
much countenance in her house, for want of something to
recommend them equally to her husband.</p>

<p>Scarcely any thing is calculated to have so deteriorating
an effect upon the mind as the constant fret of an unlawful
passion. In every one of the clandestine and stealthy
operations by which it is sought to be gratified, a step is
gained in the downward descent towards destruction. Cayley,
who was not naturally a man of wicked dispositions,
and who might have been reclaimed by this passion, had
it been virtuous, from all his trivial follies, gradually became
prepared, by the emotions which convulsed his bosom, for
an attempt involving the honour of his adored mistress,
and, consequently, her whole happiness in life, as well as
that of many innocent individuals with whom she was connected.
This he now only waited for an opportunity of
carrying into effect, and it was not long ere it was afforded.</p>

<p>Called by the urgent request of a Highland client, Mr
Macfarlane had left town somewhat suddenly, and was
not expected to return for upwards of a week. During
his absence, Mrs Macfarlane endeavoured to repress the
attentions of Mr Cayley as much as possible, from a sense
of propriety, and contented herself with a kind of society—dumb,
yet eloquent—which she felt to be much more fit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
for her situation—the society of her infant child. One
evening, however, as she sat with her tender charge hushed
to sleep upon her bosom, Mr Cayley was unexpectedly
ushered in, notwithstanding that she had given directions
for his exclusion after a certain hour, now past. To add
to her distress, he appeared a little excited, as she thought,
by liquor, but, in reality, by nothing but the burning and
madly imprudent passion which had taken possession of
him. He sat down, and gazed at her for a few moments
without speaking, while she remonstrated against this unseasonable
intrusion. She then rung her bell, in order to
chide her servant for disobedience of her orders; but Mr
Cayley tranquilly told her, that he had taken the liberty of
sending the girl away upon an errand.</p>

<p>“In the name of heaven,” said the lady, “what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean, my dear Madam,” answered he, “to have a
little conversation with you upon a subject of great importance
to us both, and which I should like to discuss without
the possibility of interruption. Know, Madam, that, ever
since I first saw you, I have fondly, madly loved you. You
are become indispensable to my existence; and it depends
upon you whether I shall hereafter be the most happy or
the most miserable of men.”</p>

<p>“Mr Cayley,” cried the lady, “what foolery is this?
You are not in your senses—you have indulged too much
in liquor. For heaven’s sake, go home; and to-morrow
you will have forgot that such ideas ever possessed your
brain.”</p>

<p>“No, never, my angel!” cried he, “can I forget that I
have seen and loved you. I might sleep for ages; and,
if I awakened at all, it would be with your image imprinted
as strongly as ever upon my heart. You now see a man
prepared for the most desperate courses in order to obtain
you. Listen for a moment. In the neighbourhood, a
coach stands ready to carry us far from every scene where
you have hitherto been known. Consent, and I procure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
for you (which is now within my power) a reversal of your
father’s attainder. You shall again possess the domains
where your fathers for ages back have been held in almost
regal veneration, and where you spent the pleasant years
of your own youth. Deny me, and to-morrow your reputation
is blasted for ever. The least plausible tale, you
well know, would be received and believed by society, if
told respecting Mrs Macfarlane.”</p>

<p>“Profligate wretch!” exclaimed the unfortunate lady;
“can I believe my ears when they tell me that such wickedness
exists in a human bosom? Look, Sir, at this infant—were
there no principles of virtue within me to dictate a
contemptuous rejection of your proposals, do you think
that I could leave this innocent to pine and die under the
cold neglect of strangers, or to survive to a less blessed life
with the stigma of a disgraced mother fixed for ever upon
her? Were I the basest woman that ever lived, as you
seem to think me, would nature permit so awful a violation
of her laws? Could I leave my child, and not next
moment be struck dead by fire from heaven for my crime?
The alternative, indeed, is awful. Well you know the
point upon which I am most easily affected. Base, however,
as you avow yourself, I cannot yet suppose that you
could be guilty of a trick so worthy of the devil himself, as
to blast the reputation, where you could not fix the real
cause of infamy.”</p>

<p>“Do not flatter yourself too much on that score,” rejoined
Cayley; “you do not now see a man actuated by
ordinary principles. I am tortured and confounded by an
impetuous passion, which you have excited. If you take
from me all hope of a consent to my first proposal, I must
endeavour to bring you into my power by the second. To-morrow,
did I say? Nay, I will go this night, and tell
every man I know that you are the slave of my passion.
Not a lady in Edinburgh but will know of it to-morrow
before she has left her pillow. You will <em>then</em>, I think, see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the necessity of consenting to the scheme of flight which
I now put into your power.”</p>

<p>He pronounced these words in such a disordered and
violent manner, that the unhappy lady sat for some time
unable to reply. She hardly recovered her senses till she
heard the outer door clang behind him, as he went upon
the demoniac purpose which he had threatened.</p>

<p>The first place that Mr Cayley went to was John’s
Coffeehouse, a fashionable tavern in the Parliament Square,
where he found a large group of his dissolute young friends,
drinking claret out of silver stoups. The company was in
an advanced stage of intoxication and riot, very much to
the annoyance, apparently, of a few smaller knots of decent
citizens, who were indulging in some more moderate potations
after the fatigues of the day, and endeavouring to
understand as much as they could of the London Intelligencer,
the Flying Post, and other little sheets of news
which lay upon the various tables. “Well, Cayley,” cried
one of the young roisterers, “come and tell us how you
are getting on now with the fair lady over the way—husband
not at home—must be making great advances, I suppose?”
“Make yourself quite at ease on that subject;
I <em>am</em> so, I assure you.” This he said in so significant
a tone, that it was at once understood. A flood of raillery,
however, was immediately opened upon him; no one would
believe what he said, or rather implied; and thus, as they
designed, he was drawn to make much more explicit declarations
of his supposed triumph. No attempt was made
by himself or others to conceal the subject of their conversation
from the rest of the individuals present. It was
understood distinctly by the sober citizens above mentioned,
some of whom shrugged their shoulders, knocked their
cocked hats firmly down upon their heads, took staff in
hand, and strode consequentially and indignantly out of
the room. As Cayley had predicted, the whole affair was
blazoned abroad before next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>Mrs Macfarlane, as might be supposed, enjoyed little
sleep after the agitations of the preceding evening. She
could hardly believe that anything so wicked as what had
been threatened by Mr Cayley could be perpetrated by a
being in human shape; but yet, recollecting the extraordinary
state in which he seemed to be, she could not
altogether assure herself of the contrary. In the forenoon
she went to pay a visit in a distant part of the town; and
she could not help remarking, that while she seemed to
have become an object of additional interest to the male
sex, the ladies, even those with whom she had formerly
been on terms of civil recognition, averted their eyes from
her, with an expression, as she thought, of contempt.</p>

<p>The lady upon whom she called received her in the
coldest manner, and, on an explanation being asked, did
not hesitate to mention what she had heard as the town’s
talk that morning, namely, that Mr Cayley professed himself
to be her favoured lover. The unfortunate lady burst
into a passion of tears and lamentations at this intelligence,
protested her innocence a thousand times, and declared
herself to be only the victim of a profligate; but still she
saw that she did not produce an entirely exculpatory effect
upon the mind of her friend. She went home in a state
of distress bordering on despair. Her early misfortunes
through the severity of the government; her dependent
situation in the houses of her kinsfolk; her unhappy marriage
to a man she could never love; and, finally, the
cruel coldness with which she had been treated by her former
friends in the days of her depression, all recurred upon
her mind, and united with the more awful grief which had
now overtaken her, prepared her mind for the most desperate
resolutions.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon she sent a note to Mr Cayley,
requesting, in the usual terms, the favour of his company.
The receipt of her billet threw him into transports of joy,
for he believed that his scheme had already taken effect,
and that she was now prepared to accede to his proposals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
He therefore dressed himself in his best style, and at the
proper hour (he felt too secure of his prey to go sooner)
walked across the street to his appointment. He was shown
into a room at the back of the house, where he had never
before been, and where there was little furniture besides a
picture of Mrs Macfarlane, painted by Sir John Medina,
an Italian artist who long practised his trade at the Scottish
capital. This portrait, which he began to gaze upon
with all the enthusiasm of a lover, represented his mistress
in a style and manner strikingly beautiful. The utmost
serenity, united with the utmost innocence, shone in those
sweetly noble features. The fair open brow glowed like
the summer sky, calmly and cloudlessly beautiful. The
eyes shone with the lustre of gladness and intelligence, and
the whole expression was resolved into an exquisite and
killing smile. The lover stood in a sort of transport before
this image of all he held dear on earth, as if he were
yielding to an idolatrous contemplation of its extraordinary
loveliness, when the door was opened—and behold the
original! Instead of the voluptuous smile which shone
on the canvass of Medina, a Beautiful Fury stood before
him—a Hecate not yet grown old. He started with horror;
for not only did she bear in her countenance the most
threatening ensigns of passion, but she carried in her hand
two large pistols, one of which she held extended to him,
while with the other hand she locked the door behind
her, at the same time keeping a watchful and glaring eye
upon her victim.</p>

<p>“Wretch,” she said, “you have ruined one who never
did you wrong. You have destroyed me as completely as
if you had stretched me lifeless beneath your hand. More
than this, you have rendered others who are dear to me
unhappy for ever. My child—you have deprived her of
the nurture of a mother; you have fixed upon her name
a stain which will never be washed out. And yet for all
this, society, cruel as it is to the victims, provides no punishment—hardly
even any censure—to the criminal. Were it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
now my will to permit you, you might walk away scatheless
from the fair scene you have ravaged, with nothing to disturb
your triumph, but the lamentations of so many broken
hearts. You shall not, however, enjoy this triumph—for
here you shall die!”</p>

<p>Cayley had stood for a few moments, gazing alternately
at her face and at the weapon she held extended towards
him. He heard her address as if he had heard it not. But
at the last word, he recovered a little of his presence of
mind, and made an effort to approach her. She at that
moment fired, but without effect. The effort of drawing
the trigger had depressed the muzzle of the weapon, and
the ball entered the floor at his feet. She lost not an
instant to present and fire the other, the shot of which
penetrated his breast, and he fell next moment before her,
with but one indistinct murmur of agony—and then all
was still.</p>

<p>One brief embrace to her child—a moment at the toilet
to arrange her travelling dress, which she had previously
prepared, and the beautiful murderess was ready
to fly. She instantly left town for the south, and, as already
mentioned, received shelter and concealment in the
house of her distant kinsman, Sir John Swinton. How
long she was there protected, is not known, but it was
probably as long as the search of justice continued to be
in the least eager. It was always understood, by those
aged persons who knew her story, and from whom the preceding
facts have chiefly been derived, that she ultimately
escaped to some remote continental state, where she was
supported by contributions from her relations. So closes
one of the most tragical tales that stain the domestic annals
of Scotland during the last century.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DOWNDRAUGHT">THE DOWNDRAUGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Side by side with <em>victims</em>, might be placed the kindred
species <em>downdraughts</em>, who are only different from the accident
of their having friends who will rather be <em>weighed
down</em> by them to the very earth—to the grave itself—than
permit them to sink by themselves. The downdraught is
in reality a victim, and one of the darkest shade, being
generally a person totally worthless in character, and
abandoned in habits; but then he has not altogether cut
the cables which bound him to his native grade in society—he
has not all forgot himself to disgrace—he is still
domesticated with his friends—he has a mother, or a wife,
or a brother, or a sister, or perhaps an old aunt, who will
try to keep him in food and clean linen, and, having lost
all hope of his ever being actively good, will do anything
for him, if he will only preserve a neutrality, and not be
positively evil. He is a victim in appearance (always
excepting the clean shirt), but he enjoys the happy superiority
over that class, of having an open door to fly to when
he pleases, and either a kind relation, who considers him
“only a little wild in the meantime,” or else one who, for
the sake of decent appearances, will endeavour to patch
up all his peccadiloes, and even be tyrannised over by him,
rather than shock society by an open rupture. The personal
tendencies of a downdraught to victimization are
strong as the currents of the great deep, but he is withheld
from it by others. He has always some anchorage or other
upon decent life, to keep him back from the gulf to which
he would otherwise hurry on. In many cases, the very
kindness and indulgence of friends was the original cause
of his becoming a downdraught. He had every thing held
to his head. He was encouraged in his pretences of headaches
as an excuse for staying away from school. When
afterwards an apprentice, he was permitted to break off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
on the score of being compelled to put on fires and sweep
out the shop. Or, perhaps, it was from none of those
causes. Possibly, he was just one of those persons who
seem to be totally destitute of all perception of the terms
upon which men are permitted to exist in this world; that
is, that they are either to be so fortunate as to have “their
fathers born before them,” so that they may accede to
wealth without exertion, or must else do something to
induce their fellow-creatures to accord them the means of
livelihood without beggary. That many persons are really
born without this great leading faculty, is unfortunately
but too indisputable; and, assuredly, they are as proper
inmates for a lunatic asylum as more frantic madmen; for
what is the use of reason, or even of talent, without the
desire of exerting it, either in one’s own behalf, or in
behalf of mankind? The terms of existence we allude to
are expressed in the text of Scripture, “By the sweat of
thy brow thou shalt earn thy bread;” so that the man
must be considered a kind of heretic, as well as a fool, who
will not, or can not, understand them. Yet the fact is so,
that many men arrive at maturity with either a sense of
these conditions of life, more or less imperfect, or no sense
of them at all. They perhaps conceive themselves to be
born to keep down the pavement of Prince’s Street with
boots one inch and a half deep in the heel, or to fumigate
the air of that elegant street with cigars at three shillings
per dozen; but that is the utmost extent to which their
notions of the purposes of life ever extend. These men,
of course, are predestined downdraughts. We see them
already with our mind’s eye, exhausting the kindness and
patience of a brother, or a wife, yea almost of a mother,
with their idle and dissolute habits—dragging those relations
slowly but surely down into misery and disgrace—and
only in the meantime saved from being kicked out of
doors, as they deserve, not by any regard for merits of
their own, for they have none, but by the tenderness of
those relations for their own reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>A decent citizen, of the name of Farney, retired about
five-and-twenty years ago from active life, and, planting
himself in a neat villa a little way beyond the southern
suburbs of Edinburgh, resolved to do nothing all the rest
of his life but enjoy the ten or twelve thousand pounds
which he had made by business. He was a placid, inoffensive
old man, only somewhat easy in his disposition, and,
therefore, too much under the control of his wife, who unfortunately
was a person of a vulgarly ambitious character.
The pair had but one child—a daughter, Eliza Farney—the
toast of all the apprentices in the South Bridge, and
really an elegant, and not unaccomplished young lady.
The only object which Mr and Mrs Farney now had in
life, besides that of enjoying all its comforts, was the disposal
of this young lady in marriage. Whenever there is
such a thing as ten thousand pounds connected with the
name of a young lady, there is generally a great deal more
fuss made about it than when the sum is said to exist in
any other shape or circumstances. It is important in the
eyes of all the young men who think themselves within shot
of it. It is important in the eyes of all the young women
who have to lament that they do not possess similar advantages.
It is important in the eyes of all the fathers and
mothers of sons, who think themselves within range of it.
And, lastly, it is important, immensely important indeed,
in the eyes of parties, young lady, mother and father, sister
or brother, who have anything to say in the disposal
of it. Money in this shape, one would almost think, is of
a different value from money in any other: the exchange
it bears against cash in business, or cash in the prospect of
him who knows he can win it, is prodigious. At the very
lowest computation, a thousand pounds in the purse of a
young lady is worth ten thousand in the stock of a man of
trade. Nay, it is astonishing what airs we have known a
few hundred pounds of this kind put on in respect, or rather
disrespect, of decent people, who were almost winning as
much in the year. In fact, the fiddle-faddle about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
disposal of an heiress is a great farce, and never fails to put
either the parties concerned in the disposal, or else the
candidates for the acquisition, into a thousand shabby and
selfish attitudes. It is hard to say if the young lady herself
is the better for it all. The only <em>certain</em> effect of her
possessing a fortune, is, that it deprives her of ever having
the pleasing assurance, given to most other women, that
she is married for her own sake alone. Sincere love is
apt to retire from such a competition, through the pure
force of modesty, its natural accompaniment; and the man
most apt to be successful is he who, looking upon the
affair as only a mercantile adventure, pursues it as such,
and only hopes to be able to fall in love after marriage.</p>

<p>It happened that Eliza Farney was loved, truly and
tenderly loved, by a young man of the name of Russell,
whose parents had been acquainted with the Farneys in
their earlier and less prosperous days, but were now left
a little behind them. Young Russell had been the playmate
of Eliza in their days of childhood; he had read
books with her, and taught her to draw, in their riper
youth; and all the neighbours said, that, but for the brilliant
prospects of Miss Farney, she could not have found
a more eligible match. Russell, however, was still but the
son of a poor man. He was himself struggling in the commencement
of a business, which he had begun with slender
means, in order to sustain the declining fortunes of his
parents. His walk in life was much beneath the scope
of his abilities, much beneath his moral deserts; but,
under a strong impulse of duty, he had narrowed his
mind to the path allotted to him, instead of attempting to
do justice to his talents by entering upon any higher and
more perilous pursuit. Thus, as often happens, an intellect
and character, which might have brightened the highest
destinies, were doomed to a sphere all unmeet for them,
where they were in a manner worse than lost, as they only
led to a suspicion which was apt to be unfavourable to the
prospects of their possessor, namely, that he was likely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
be led, by his superior tastes, into pursuits to which his
fortune was inadequate, or into habits which would shipwreck
it altogether. Russell looked upon Eliza Farney,
and despaired. He saw her, as she advanced into womanhood,
recede gradually from his sphere in society, and enter
into one more suitable to her father’s improving fortunes,
into which it was not for him to intrude. Eliza had, perhaps,
entertained at one time a girlish fondness for him;
but it was not of so strong a character as to resist the ambitious
maxims of her mother, and the sense of her own
importance and prospects, which began to act upon her in
her riper years.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Amongst the rest young Edwin sighed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But never talked of love.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Some appearance of coldness, which he saw, or fancied
he saw, in her conduct towards him, caused his proud and
pure nature to shrink back from the vulgar competition
which he saw going forward for the hand of “the heiress.”
It was not that the fondest wishes of his heart were met
with disappointment—perhaps he could have endured that—but
he writhed under the reflection, that external circumstances
should separate hearts that once were allied,
and that no conscious purity of feeling, no hope of hereafter
distinguishing himself by his abilities, was of avail
against the selfish and worldly philosophy which dictated
his rejection. It was only left for him to retire into the
chambers of his own thoughts, and there form such solemn
resolutions for improving his circumstances and distinguishing
his character, as might hereafter, perhaps, enable him
to prove to the cold being who now despised him, how
worthy, how more than worthy, perhaps, he was of having
enjoyed her affections, even upon the mean calculations
by which he was now measured and found wanting.</p>

<p>The mother, to whom this rupture was chiefly owing,
now applied herself heartily to the grand task of getting
her daughter “properly disposed of.” Every month or
so, her house was turned topsy-turvy, for the purpose of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
showing off the young lady in gay assemblies. Care was
taken that no one should be invited to these assemblies
who was merely of their own rank. Unless some capture
could be made in a loftier, or what appeared a loftier
circle, it was all as nothing. The human race hang all in
a concatenation at each other’s skirts, those before kicking
with all their might to drive off those behind them, at the
same time that they are struggling might and main, despite
of corresponding kicks, to hold fast, and pull themselves
up by means of their own predecessors. This is
particularly the case where a mother has a daughter to
dispose of with the reversion of a few thousands. Money
under these circumstances, as already explained, would
be absolutely thrown away if given only to a person who
estimated it at its ordinary value; it must be given to one
who will appreciate it as it ought to be, and sell pounds of
free-will and honourable manhood for shillings of the vile
dross. At length, at a ball held in the Archers’ Hall—a
kind of Almack’s in the east—the very man was met with—a
genteel young spark, said to be grand-nephew to a
baronet in the north, and who was hand in glove with the
Greigsons, a family of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quis quis</i> gentility in the New Town,
but who loomed very large in the eyes of a person dwelling
in the south side. This fellow, a mere loose adventurer,
whose highest destiny seemed to be to carry a pair of colours
if he could get them, and who positively had no claims
upon consideration whatsoever, except that he kept a decent
suit of clothes upon his back, and was on terms of
intimacy with a family supposed to belong to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut ton</i>—this
poor unanealed wretch, recommended by impudence
and a moustache, which he amiably swore he would take
off when married, gained the prize from which the modest
merit of Russell was repelled. In a perfect fluster of delight
with the attentions he paid to her daughter, terrified
lest he should change his mind, or any unforeseen event
prevent the consummation so devoutly to be wished, the
managing mother presented no obstruction to the courtship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
“Such a genteel young man!” she would say to her husband.
“He is greatly taken out in good company. Just
the night before last, he was at the Honourable Mrs ——’s
party in Oman’s Rooms. He danced with Miss Forster,
the great heiress, who, they say, is distractedly in love
with him. But he says she has naething like the elegant
carriage o’ our ’Liza. Indeed, between you and me, says
he, jokingly, to me the other day, she’s splay-footed. He
could make his fortune at once, you see, however, and I’m
sure it’s really extraordinary o’ him to particulareese the
like o’ us in the way he’s doing”—and so forth. The old
man sat twirling his thumbs and saying nothing, but having
his own fears all the time that all was not really gold that
glittered. He was, however, one of those people who,
upon habit and principle, never say a single word about
any speculative thing that is proposed to them, till the
result has been decided, and then they can tell that they
all along thought it would turn out so. It was untelling
the prescience and wisdom that old Farney believed himself
to be thus possessed of. Suffice it to say, the managing
mother, within the month, made out a mittimus of destruction
in favour of her daughter, Eliza Farney, spinster,
consigning her to the custody of William Dempster,
Esq., blackguard by commission, and downdraught by
destiny.</p>

<p>The fortune of Miss Farney was not exactly of the
kind that suited Mr Dempster’s views. It was only
payable after the death of her father. Mr Dempster,
therefore, saw it to be necessary to take expedients for
obtaining the use of it by anticipation. He commenced a
large concern in some mercantile line, obtaining money in
advance from the old gentleman, in order to set the establishment
on foot. He also procured his signature to innumerable
bills, to enable him to carry it on. The business,
in reality, was a mere mask for obtaining the means of
supporting his own depraved tastes and appetites. There
was hardly any kind of extravagance, any kind of vice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
which he did not indulge in at the expense of old Farney.
The result was what might be expected from such premises.
Exactly a twelvemonth after the marriage, Dempster stopped
payment, and absconded without so much as even taking
leave of his wife. His folly and profligacy together had
already absorbed the whole fortune with which Mr Farney
had retired from business, besides a good deal more for
which the unfortunate old man was security. He was in
consequence totally ruined, left destitute in old age, without
the least resource; while the young elegant female,
who a short year before was the admiration and envy of
glittering circles, had just become a mother, upon the bed
which only waited for her convalescence to be sold for
behoof of her husband’s creditors.</p>

<p>Farney found refuge—and considered himself most fortunate
in finding it—in a beneficiary institution for decayed
citizens, of which he had himself, in better days,
been one of the managers, but which he did not live long
to enjoy. His wife, about the same time, died of one of
those numberless and varied diseases which can only be
traced to what is called a broken heart. The daughter—the
unhappy, and, in a great measure, guiltless victim of
her wretched ambition—had no eventual resource, for the
support of herself and her infant, but to open a small school,
in which she taught female children the elements of reading,
writing, and sewing. The striking infelicity of her fate, joined
to her own well-known taste and industrious habits, in time
obtained for her considerable patronage in this humble occupation;
and she would eventually have been restored
to something like comfort, but for the unhallowed wretch
whose fate had become identified with her own. Where
this fellow went, or how he subsisted, for the three years
during which he was absent, no one ever knew. He was
heard to talk of the smugglers in the Isle of Man, but it
can only be surmised that he joined that respectable corps.
One day, as Mrs Dempster sat in the midst of her little
flock of pupils, the door was opened, and in crawled her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
prodigal husband, emaciated, travel-worn, and beggar-like,
with a large black spot upon one of his cheeks, the result
of some unimaginably low and scoundrelly brawl. The
moment she recognised him, she fainted in her chair; the
children dispersed and fled from the house, like a flock of
chickens at sight of the impending hawk; and when the
unfortunate woman recovered, she found herself alone with
this transcendant wretch, the breaker of the peace of her
family, the murderer of her mother. He accosted her in
the coolest manner possible, said he was glad to see her
so comfortably situated, and expressed an anxiety for food
and liquor. She went with tottering steps to purvey what
he wanted; and while she was busied in her little kitchen,
he sat down by her parlour fire, and commenced
smoking from a nasty black pipe, after the manner of the
lowest mendicants. When food and drink were set before
him, he partook of both with voracious appetite. Mrs
Dempster sat looking on in despair, for she saw that the
presence of this being must entirely blight the pleasant
scene which her industry had created around her. She
afterwards said, however, that she could have perhaps
overlooked all, and even again loved this deplorable wretch,
if he had inquired for his child, or expressed a desire to
see him. He did neither—he seemed altogether bent on
satisfying his own gross appetites. After spending a few
hours in sulky unintermitted smoking and drinking, he was
conveyed to a pallet in the garret, there to sleep off his
debauch.</p>

<p>It were needless to go through all the distressing details
of what ensued. Dempster henceforth became a <em>downdraught</em>
on his wife. This forlorn woman often confessed
to her friends that she was perfectly willing to support her
husband, provided he would be but content with the
plain fare she could offer him, and just walk about and
do nothing. But he was not of a temper to endure this
listlessness. He required excitement. Instead of quietly
spending his forenoons in the arbour, called <em>the Cage</em>, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
Meadows, among decayed military pensioners, and other
harmless old men, he prowled about the crowded mean
thoroughfares, drinking where he could get liquor for
nothing, and roistering in companies of the most debased
description. He incurred debts in all directions on the
strength of his wife’s character, and she was necessarily
compelled to liquidate them. The struggles which she at
this time made were very great. Like the mother of Gray
the poet, she endured all kinds of ill usage, and persevered
under every difficulty to give her son a respectable education,
in order that he might have an opportunity of wiping
away the stains of his father’s vices, and be a comfort to
his mother in the decline of life. To do this, and at the
same time continue paying the vile debts of her profligate
husband, was altogether impossible. She exhausted the
beneficence, and even tired the pity of her friends. It
need hardly be mentioned, that the creditors of a husband
have an undeniable claim upon the effects of his wife. It
unfortunately happened that the wretches with whom
Dempster contracted his debts, were as worthless as himself.
After draining every resource which his wife could
command, he summed up his villainy by giving a promissory
note for fifteen pounds to one of his lowest associates.
It is supposed that he struck the bargain for a couple of
guineas, for with this sum he again absconded from Edinburgh,
and, taking his way to Greenock, shipped himself
on board of a vessel for America. At first, his wife was
thankful for the relief; she again breathed freely; but her
joy was soon turned into mourning. The promissory note
made its appearance; she had just scraped up and paid
her rent; she had not therefore a farthing in the world.
In a fortnight, the whole of her effects were sold upon distraint.
She was turned to the street a second time, almost
bent to the dust with the burden of her miseries. The
first night she received shelter in the house of a respectable
“much-tried” widow, who was the only person she could
freely speak to about her destitute condition. Next day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
by the advice of this good woman, she took a room in the
neighbourhood, and endeavoured to gather together her
pupils, who, it seems, did not desert her, but took a deep
interest in her misfortunes. She had also the good fortune
to get her boy into one of the educational hospitals, and
she therefore expressed herself thankful for the mercies she
still received.</p>

<p>An interval of many years now occurs in the story of
Mrs Dempster, during which she heard nothing of her
husband, except a rumour that he was drowned on a lumbering
excursion in the rapids of the St Lawrence. Through
the influence of her pitiable tale and real merit, she obtained
the situation of superintendant of a large public seminary
for young ladies in a country town. Here she lived in
peace, comfort, and honour, for some years, till she had
almost forgot that ever such a wretch as Dempster existed.
What was her horror one day, when, as she was entertaining
a large party of respectable people at tea, the demon of
her fate stood once more before her, not the mere squalid
beggar which he formerly appeared, but a concentration of
blackguardism and shabbiness, of utterly ruined and broken-down
humanity, such as was never perhaps surpassed, even
in the sinks of London and Parisian vice. There was now
more than mendicancy in his aspect—there was robbery,
murder, and every kind of desperate deed. The wan face,
blackened and battered with bruises and wounds—the
troubled eye, bespeaking the troubled spirit—the ropy,
sooty attire, through which peeped the hardly whiter skin—the
feet bare, and ulcerated with walking—every thing
told but one tale of unutterable sin and misery. The guests
shrunk aghast from this hideous spectre, and the hostess
shrieked outright. Little regarding the alarm which he
had occasioned, he exclaimed, in a hollow and scarcely
earthly voice, “Give me meat—give me drink—give me
clothing—I am destitute of all; there you sit in enjoyment
of every luxury, while your husband, who is flesh of your
flesh, has not known what it is to eat heartily, or to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
covered from the piercing wind, for weeks and months.
Shrink not from me. Wretched as I seem, I am still your
husband. Nothing on earth can break that tie. Meat,
I say—drink—I am in my own house, and will be obeyed.
For you, gentles, get you gone; your company is not now
agreeable.” The company dispersed without farther ceremony,
leaving the unhappy woman alone with her husband.</p>

<p>Next day, the stranger appeared abroad in a decent suit
of clothes, and Mrs Dempster seemed to have recovered a
little of her equanimity. Every sacrifice, however, which
she could make for this wretch, was in vain, or only encouraged
him to demand greater indulgences. An unlimited
supply of liquor in his own house would not satisfy him.
He required large sums wherewith to treat all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i>
of the town. Entreaties, indulgences, every thing that
could be devised to gratify him, were unavailing to impress
him with a sense of his wife’s situation. He intruded his
unhallowed front into her school, and insulted her before
her pupils. Those who laughed at his antics he would
seize by the shoulders, and turn out of doors. He had
also a most perverse desire of pushing himself into her
presence, whenever he thought she was conversing with
any of her employers, before whom an observance of propriety
and decorum was most particularly necessary. Indeed,
he just delighted to do exactly what his wife wished
him not to do, the grand object of his low mind being to
show how much he had her comfort and welfare in his
power. At length, with every feeling of respect for Mrs
Dempster, her employers, the magistrates, found it necessary
to inform her, that they could not permit her to retain
the school any longer under such circumstances, as it was
threatened with utter annihilation by the gradual diminution
of the number of pupils. She proposed to her husband to
allow him regularly the full half of her earnings, if he would
only stay in some other place, and never again intrude upon
her. But he scorned to be bought off, as he said. He
insisted rather upon her giving up the school, and accompanying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
him to Edinburgh, where, with the little sum she
had saved, and what besides they could raise by the sale
of her superfluous furniture, he would enter into business
on his own account, and she should never again be obliged
to work for either herself or for him. The poor woman
had no alternative. She was compelled to abandon the
scene, where for so many years she had enjoyed the comforts
of life and the respect of society, in order to be dragged
at the chariot wheels, or rather at the cart’s tail, of her
husband’s vices and fortunes, through scenes to which she
shuddered to look forward.</p>

<p>In the capital, Dempster’s design of entering into
business, if he ever seriously entertained it, was no more
talked of. Fleshed once again with a taste of his former
indulgences, he rushed headlong into that infamous career,
which already had twice ended in voluntary banishment.
His wife’s finances were soon exhausted; but,
with the barbarity of a demon taskmaster, he would every
day leave her with a threat, which she but too well knew
he would execute, of beating her, if she should not be able
to produce next morning a sum necessary for the gratification
of his wretched appetites. It was now in vain to attempt
that mode of subsistence by which she had hitherto supported
herself. So long as she was haunted by this evil
genius, <em>that</em> was impracticable. By the interest, however,
of some of her former friends, she obtained a scanty and
precarious employment for her needle, by which she endeavoured
to supply the cravings of her husband, and her own
simpler wants. From morning early, through the whole
day, and till long after midnight, this modest and virtuous
woman would sit in her humble lodging, painfully exerting
herself at a tedious and monotonous task, that she might
be able to give to her husband in the morning that sum,
without which she feared he would only rush into greater
mischief, if not into absolute crime. No vigils were
grudged, if she only had the gratification at last of seeing
him return. Though he often staid away the whole night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
she never could permit herself to suppose that he would
do so again, but she would sit bending over her work, or,
if she could work no more from positive fatigue, gazing into
the dying embers of her fire, watching and watching for
the late and solitary foot, which, by a strange exertion of
the sense, she could hear and distinguish long ere any
sound would have been perceptible to another person.
Alas, for the sleepless nights which woman so often endures
for the sake of her cruel helpmate! Alas, for the
generous and enduring affection which woman cherishes
so often for the selfish heart by which it is enslaved!</p>

<p>A time at length arrived when the supplies purveyed by
Mrs Dempster from her own earnings were quite incompetent
to satisfy this living vampire. She saw him daily
rush from her presence, threatening that he would bring
her to the extremity of disgrace by the methods he would
take to obtain money. She lived for weeks in the agonising
fear that the next moment would bring her news of some
awful crime committed by his hand, and for which he was
likely to suffer the last penalty of the law. She hardly
knew who or what were his associates; but occasionally
she learned, from mutterings in his sleep, that his practices
were of the most flagitious and debased kind. He seemed
to be the leader or director of a set of wretches who made
a livelihood by midnight burglary. At length, one day he
came home at an unusual hour, accompanied by three
strangers, with whom he entered into conversation in the
next room. Between that apartment and the room in
which he was sitting, there was a door, which, being never
used, was locked up. Through the thin panels, she overheard
a scheme laid for entering the house of ——, a
villa in the neighbourhood, in order to rob the tenant,
whom they described as a gentleman just returned from
the East Indies, with a great quantity of plate and other
valuables. One of the persons in conference had visited
the house, through the kindness of a servant, to whom he
had made up as a sweetheart; and he therefore was able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
to lead the attack through such a channel as rendered
success almost certain. “The nabob,” said this person,
“sleeps in a part of the house distant from the room in
which his boxes are for the present deposited. But should
he attempt to give us any disturbance, we have a remedy
for that, you know.” And here the listener’s blood ran
cold at hearing a pistol cocked. From all that she could
gather, her husband was only to keep watch at the outside
of the house, while the rest should enter in search of the
booty. It is impossible to describe the horror with which
she heard the details of the plot. Her mind was at first
in such a whirl of distracted feeling, that she hardly knew
where she stood; but as the scheme was to be executed
that very evening, she saw it necessary to exert herself
quickly and decisively, and, therefore, she immediately
went to the house of a friend, and wrote an anonymous
note to the person most concerned, warning him of a design
(she could use no more specific language) which she
knew was entertained against a certain part of his property,
and recommending him to have it removed to some more
secure part of his house. To make quite sure of this note
being delivered in time, she took it herself to the gate, and
left it with the porter, whom she strictly enjoined to give
it immediately into the hands of his master. She then
went home, and spent an evening of misery more bitter
than the cup of death itself. She had formerly passed
many a lonely night at her cheerless fireside, while waiting
for the return of her wretched husband; but she never
spent one like this. When she reflected upon the happiness
of her early days, and the splendid prospects which
were then said to lie before her, and contrasted them with
the misery into which she had been so suddenly plunged,
not by any fault of her own, but, as it appeared, by the
mere course of destiny, she could have almost questioned
the justice of that supreme power, by which she piously
believed the concerns of this lower world to be adjusted.
What dire calamities had sprung to her from one unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
step! What persecutions she had innocently endured!
How hopeless was her every virtuous exertion
against the perverse counteraction of a being from whom
society could not permit her to be disjoined! And, finally,
what an awful outburst of wretchedness was at this moment,
to appearance, impending over her! Then she
recalled one gentle recollection, which occasionally would
steal into her mind, even in her darkest hours, and fill it
with an agreeable but still painful light—the thought of
Russell—Russell, the kind and good, whom, in a moment
of girlish vanity, she had treated harshly, so that he vanished
from her presence for ever, and even from the place
where he had suffered her scorn. Had fate decreed that
she should have been united to that endeared mate of her
childhood, how different might have been her lot!—how
different, also, perhaps, might have been his course of life!—for
she feared that her ungenerous cruelty had also made
shipwreck of his noble nature. These meditations were
suddenly disturbed by the entrance of Dempster, who
rushed into her room, holding a handkerchief upon his
side, and, pale, gory, and breathless, fell upon the ground
before her. Almost ere she had time to ascertain the
reality of this horrid vision, quick footsteps were heard
upon the stair. The open door gave free admission, and in
a moment the room was half filled with watchmen, at the
head of whom appeared a middle-aged gentleman, of a prepossessing
though somewhat disordered exterior. “This,”
he exclaimed, “is the villain; secure him, if he be yet
alive, but I fear he has already met the punishment which
is his due.” The watchmen raised Dempster from the
ground, and, holding his face to the light, found that the
glaze of death was just taking effect upon his eyes. The
unhappy woman shrieked as she beheld the dreadful spectacle,
and would have fallen upon the ground if she had
not been prevented by the stranger, who caught her in his
arms. Her eyes, when they first re-opened, were met by
those of <span class="smcap">Russell</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the feelings with which
these long-severed hearts again recognised each other, the
wretchedness into which she was plunged, by learning that
her well-intended efforts had unexpectedly led to the death
of her husband, or the returning tide of grateful and affectionate
emotion which possessed his bosom, on being
informed that those efforts had saved his life, not to speak
of the deep sensation of pity with which he listened to the
tale of her life. A tenderer feeling than friendship was now
impossible, and, if it could have existed, would have hardly
been in good taste; but Russell, now endowed with that
wealth which, when he had it not, would have been of so
much avail, contented himself to use it in the pious task
of rendering the declining years of Eliza Farney as happy
as her past life had been miserable.</p>

</div>


<p class="no-indent">In the course of a ramble through the western part of Fife,
I descended one evening upon the ancient burgh of Culross,
which is situated on a low stripe of land beside the sea-shore,
with a line of high grounds rising behind it, upon
which are situated the old abbey church and the ruins of
a very fine mansion-house, once the residence of the lords
of the manor. On stepping forth next morning from the
little inn, I found that the night had been stormy, and that
the waves of the Forth were still rolling with considerable
violence, so as to delay the usual passage of the ferry-boat
to Borrowstouness. Having resolved to cross to that
part of the opposite shore, I found that I should have ample
time, before the boat could proceed, to inspect those remains
of antiquity, which now give the burgh almost its
only importance in the eyes of a traveller. The state of
the atmosphere was in the highest degree calculated to increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the interest of these objects. It was a day of gloom,
scarcely different from night. The sky displayed that fixed
dulness which so often succeeds a nocturnal tempest; the
sea was one sheet of turbid darkness, save where chequered
by the breaking wave. The streets and paths of the little
village-burgh showed, each by its deep and pebbly seam,
how much rain had fallen during the night; and all the
foliage of the gardens and woods around, as well as the
walls of the houses, were still drenched with wet. Having
secured the services of the official called the <em>bedral</em>, I was
conducted to the abbey church, which is a very old Gothic
structure, but recently repaired and fitted up as a parochial
place of worship. It was fitting, in such a gloomy
day, to inspect the outlines of abbots and crusaders which
still deck the pavement of this ancient temple; and there
was matter, perhaps, for still more solemn reflection in the
view of the adjacent mansion-house. Culross Abbey, as
this structure is called, was finished so lately as the reign
of Charles the Second, and by the same architect with
Holyrood House, which it far exceeded in magnificence.
Yet, as the premature ruin of youthful health is a more
affecting object than the ripe decline of age, so did this
roofless modern palace, with the wallflower waving from
its elegant Grecian windows, present a more dismal aspect
than could have been expected from any ruin of more hoary
antiquity. The tale which it told of the extinction of
modern grandeur, and the decline of recently flourishing
families, appealed more immediately and more powerfully
to the sympathies than that of remote and more barbarous
greatness, which is to be read in the sterner battlements of
a border tower, or an ancient national fortress. The site
had been chosen upon a lofty terrace overlooking the sea,
in order that the inmates might be enlivened by the ever-changing
aspect of that element, and the constant transit
of its ships; but now all useless was this peculiarity of
situation, except to serve to the mariner as a kind of landmark,
or to supply the more contemplative voyager with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the subject of a sigh. With a mind attuned by this object
to the most melancholy reflections, I was conducted to
what is called an aisle or burial vault, projecting from the
north side of the church, and which contains the remains
of the former lords of Culross. There images are shown,
cut in beautiful Italian marble, of Sir —— Bruce, his lady,
and several children, all of which must have been procured
from the Continent at a great expense; for this honourable
knight and his family flourished in the early part of the
seventeenth century, when no such art was practised in
Scotland. The images, however, and the whole sepulchre,
had a neglected and desolate appearance, as may be expected
by the greatest of personages, when their race has
become unknown at the scene of their repose. In this
gloomy chamber of the heirless dead, I was shown a projection
from one of the side-walls, much like an altar, over
which was painted on the wall the mournfully appropriate
and expressive word “<span class="smcap">Fuimus</span>.” Below was an inscription
on a brass plate, importing that this was the resting
place of the heart of Edward Lord Bruce of Kinloss, formerly
proprietor of the princely estate of Culross; and
that the story connected with it was to be found related
in the Guardian, and alluded to in Clarendon’s History of
the Great Rebellion. It was stated that the heart was
enclosed in a silver case of its own shape, which had reposed
here ever since it ceased to beat with the tide of
mortal life in the year 1613, except that it was raised from
its cell for a brief space in 1808, in the course of some
repairs upon the sepulchre. As I had a perfect recollection
of the story told by Steele, which indeed had made a deep
impression upon me in boyhood, it was with no small
interest that I beheld the final abode of an object so immediately
connected with it. It seemed as if time had been
betrayed, and two centuries annihilated, when I thus found
myself in presence of the actual membrane, in bodily substance
entire, which had, by its proud passions, brought
about the catastrophe of that piteous tale. What! thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
I, and does the heart of Edward Bruce, which beat so
long ago with emotions now hardly known among men,
still exist at this spot, as if the friends of its owner had
resolved that so noble a thing should never find decay?
The idea had in it something so truly captivating, that it
was long ere I could quit the place, or return to the feelings
of immediate existence. The whole scene around, and
the little neglected burgh itself, had now become invested
with a fascinating power over me; and I did not depart
till I had gathered, from the traditions of the inhabitants,
the principal materials of the following story, aiding them,
after I had reached home, by reference to more authentic
documents:—</p>

<p>Edward Lord Bruce of Kinloss, the second who bore the
title, was the son of the first lord, who is so memorable in
history as a serviceable minister to King James the Sixth
during the latter years of his Scottish reign, having been
chiefly instrumental, along with the Earl of Mar, in smoothing
the way for his majesty’s succession to Queen Elizabeth.
After the death of his father, the young Lord Bruce continued,
along with his mother, to enjoy high consideration
in the English court. He was a contemporary and playmate
of Henry Prince of Wales, whom he almost equalled in
the performance of all noble sports and exercises, while,
from his less cold character, he was perhaps a greater favourite
among those who were not prepossessed in favour
of youthful royalty. There was not, perhaps, in the whole
of the English court, any young person of greater promise,
or more endearing qualities, than Lord Bruce, though, in
respect of mere external accomplishments, he was certainly
rivalled by his friend Sir George Sackville, a younger son
of the Earl of Dorset. This young gentleman, who was
the grandson of one poet,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and destined to be the grandsire
of another,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was one of those free and dashing spirits, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
according to the accounts of contemporary writers, kept
the streets of London in an almost perpetual brawl, by
night and by day, with their extravagant frolics, or, more
generally, the feuds arising out of them. His heart and genius
were naturally good, but the influence of less innocent
companions gradually betrayed him into evil habits; and
thus many generous faculties, which might have adorned
the highest profession, were in him perverted to the basest
uses. It was often a subject of wonder that the pure and
elevated nature of young Lord Bruce should tolerate the
reckless profligacy of Sackville; but those who were surprised
did not take a very extended view of human nature.
The truth is, that real goodness is often imposed upon by
vice, and sees in it more to attract and delight than it does
in goodness similar to itself. The gentle character of Bruce
clung to the fierce and turbulent nature of Sackville, as if
it found in that nature a protection and comfort which it
needed. Perhaps there was something, also, in the early
date of their intimacy, which might tend to fix the friendship
of these dissimilar minds. From their earliest boyhood
they had been thrown together as pages in the household
of the prince, where their education proceeded, step by
step, in union, and every action and every duty was the
same. It was further remarked, that, while the character
of Bruce appeared always to be bolder in the presence of
Sackville than on other occasions, that of Sackville was
invariably softened by juxtaposition with Bruce; so that
they had something more like a common ground to meet
upon than could previously have been suspected.</p>

<p>When the two young men were about fourteen, and as
yet displayed little more than the common features of innocent
boyhood, Sackville was permitted by his parents to
accompany Bruce on a summer visit to the paternal estates
of the young nobleman in Scotland. There they enjoyed
together, for some weeks, all the sports of the season and
place, which seemed to be as untiring as their own mutual
friendship. One day, as they were preparing to go out a-hunting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
an aged woman, who exercised the trade of <em>spaewife</em>,
or fortune-teller, came up to the gate. The horses
upon which they had just mounted were startled by the
uncouth appearance of the stranger, and that ridden by
Sackville was so very restive as nearly to throw him off.
This caused the young Englishman to address her in language
of not the most respectful kind; nor could all the
efforts of Lord Bruce, who was actuated by different feelings,
prevent him from aiming at her once or twice with
his whip.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Sackville,” said Lord Bruce, “take
care lest she make us all repent of this. Don’t you see
that she is a spaewife?”</p>

<p>“What care I for your spaewives?” cried Sackville.
“All I know is, that she is a cursed old beggar or gipsy,
and has nearly caused me break my neck!”</p>

<p>“I tell you she is a witch and a fortune-teller,” said his
gentler companion; “and there is not a man in the country
but would rather have his neck broken than say any thing
to offend her.”</p>

<p>The woman, who had hitherto stood with a face beaming
with indignation, now broke out—</p>

<p>“Ride on to your hunting, young man,” addressing
Sackville; “you will not have the better sport for abusing
the helpless infirmities of old age. Some day you two will
go out to a different kind of sport, and one only will come
back alive; alive, but wishing that he rather had been
doomed to the fate of his companion.”</p>

<p>Both Sackville and Bruce were for the time deeply impressed
with this denunciation, to which the superstitious
feelings of the age gave greater weight than can now be
imagined; and even while they mutually swore that hostility
between them was impossible, they each secretly
wished that the doom could be unsaid. Its chief immediate
effect was to deepen and strengthen their friendship. Each
seemed to wish, by bestowing more and more affection
upon his companion, at once to give to himself a better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
assurance of his own disposition to quarrel, and to his
friend a stronger reason for banishing the painful impression
from his mind. Perhaps this was one reason—and one
not the less strong that it was in some measure unconscious—why,
on the separation of their characters in
ripening manhood, they still clung to each other with such
devoted attachment.</p>

<p>In process of time, a new and more tender relation arose
between these two young men, to give them mutually better
assurance against the doom which had been pronounced
upon them. Lady Clementina Sackville, eldest daughter
of the Earl of Dorset, was just two years younger than
Sir George and his friend, and there was not a more beautiful
or accomplished gentlewoman in the court of Queen
Anne. Whether in the walking of a minuet, or in the
personation of a divine beauty in one of Ben Jonson’s court
masks, Lady Clementina was alike distinguished; while
her manners, so far from betraying that pride which so often
attends the triumphs of united beauty and talent, were
of the most unassuming and amiable character. It was not
possible that two such natures as those of Lord Bruce and
Lady Clementina Sackville should be frequently in communion,
as was their case, without contracting a mutual
affection of the strongest kind. Accordingly, it soon became
understood that the only obstacle to their union was
their extreme youth, which rendered it proper that they
should wait for one or two years, before their fortunes,
like their hearts, should be made one. It unfortunately
happened that this was the very time when the habits of
Sir George Sackville made their greatest decline, and when,
consequently, it was most difficult for Bruce to maintain
the friendship which hitherto subsisted between them.
The household of Lord Dorset was one of that sober cast,
which, in the next age, was characterised by the epithet
puritanical. As such, of course, it suited with the temper
of Lord Bruce, who, though not educated in Scotland,
had been impressed by his mother with the grave sentiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and habits of his native country. Often then did
he mourn with the amiable family of Dorset over the
errors of his friend; and many was the night which he
spent innocently in that peaceful circle, while Sir George
roamed about, in company with the most wicked and wayward
spirits of the time.</p>

<p>One night, after he had enjoyed with Lady Clementina
a long and delightful conversation respecting their united
prospects, Sir George came home in a state of high intoxication
and excitement, exclaiming loudly against a Scotch
gentleman with whom he had had a street quarrel, and who
had been rescued, as he said, from his sword, only by the
unfair interference of some other “beggarly Scots.” It
was impossible for a Scotsman of Bruce’s years to hear his
countrymen spoken of in this way without anger; but he
repressed every emotion, till his friend proceeded to generalise
upon the character of these “beggarly Scots,” and
extended his obloquy from the individuals to the nation.
Lord Bruce then gently repelled his insinuations, and said,
that surely there was one person at least whom he would
exempt from the charge brought against his country. “I
will make no exemptions,” said the infatuated Sackville,
“and least of all in favour of a cullion who sits in his friend’s
house, and talks of him puritanically behind his back.”
Bruce felt very bitterly the injustice of this reproach; but
the difficulty of shaping a vindication rendered his answer
more passionate than he wished; and it was immediately
replied to by Sackville with a contemptuous blow upon
the face. There, in a moment, fell the friendship of years,
and deadly gall usurped the place where nothing before
had been but “the milk of kindness.” Lady Clementina,
to whom the whole affair seemed a freak of a hurried and
unnatural dream, was shocked beyond measure by the violence
of her brother; but she was partly consoled by the
demeanour of Bruce, who had the address entirely to disguise
his feelings in her presence, and to seem as if he
looked upon the insult as only a frolic. But though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
appeared quite cool, the blow and words of Sackville had
sunk deep into his soul; and after brooding over the event
for a few hours, he found that his very nature had become,
as it were, changed. That bitterest of pains—the pain of
an unrequited blow—possessed and tortured his breast;
nor was the reflection that the injurer was his friend, and
not at the time under the control of reason, of much avail
in allaying his misery. Strange though it be, the unkindness
of a friend is the most sensibly felt and most promptly
resented; and we are never so near becoming the irreconcilable
enemies of any fellow-creature, as at the moment
when we are interchanging with him the most earnest and
confiding affection. Similar feelings possessed Sackville,
who had really felt of late some resentment at Lord Bruce,
on account of certain references which had been made by
his parents to the regret expressed by this young nobleman
respecting his present course of life. To apologise
for his rudeness was not to be thought of; and, accordingly,
these two hearts, which for years had beat in unison, became
parted at once, like rocks split by one of the convulsions
of nature, and a yawning and impassable gulf was
left between.</p>

<p>For some weeks after, the young men never met; Sackville
took care never to intrude into the family circle, and
Bruce did not seek his company. It appeared as if the
unfortunate incident had been forgotten by the parties
themselves, and totally unknown to the world. One day,
however, Bruce was met in Paul’s Walk by a young friend
and countryman, of the name of Crawford, a rambling slip
of Scottish nobility, whose very sword seemed, from the
loose easy way in which it was disposed by his side, to
have a particular aptitude for starting up in a quarrel.
After some miscellaneous conversation, Crawford expressed
his regret at a story which had lately come to his ears,
respecting a disagreement between Sackville and Bruce.
“What!” he said, “one might have as well expected
Castor and Pollux to rise from their graves and fall a-fighting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
as that you two should have had a tussle! But, of
course, the affair was confined merely to words, which,
we all know, matter little between friends. The story
about the batter on the face must be a neat figment clapped
upon the adventure by Lady Fame.”</p>

<p>“Have you indeed heard,” asked Bruce, in some agitation,
“that any such incident took place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure,” replied his companion; “the whole
Temple has been ringing with it for the last few days, as
I am assured by my friend Jack Topper. And I heard it
myself spoken of last week to the west of Temple Bar.
Indeed, I believe it was Sackville himself who told the
tale at first among some of his revellers; but, for my part,
I think it not a whit the more true or likely on that account.”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Bruce, with deep emotion, “too true. He
did strike me, and I, for sake of friendship and love, did
not resent it. But what, Crawford, could I do in the
presence of my appointed bride, to right myself with her
brother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure,” said Crawford, “that is all very true
as to the time when the blow was given; but then, you
know, there has been a great deal of time since. And,
love here or love there, people will speak of such a thing
in their ordinary way. The story was told the other day
in my presence to the French ambassador; and Monsieur’s
first question was, ‘Doth the man yet live?’ When told
that he was both living and life-like, he shrugged his
shoulders, and looked more than I can tell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Crawford,” said Bruce, “you agonise me. I
hoped that this painful tale would be kept between ourselves,
and that there would be no more of it. I still
hoped, although tremblingly, that my union with the woman
I love would be accomplished, and that all should
then be made up. But now I feel that I have been but
too truly foredoomed. That union must be anticipated
by a very different event.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“You know best,” said the careless Crawford, “what
is best for your own honour.” And away he tripped, leaving
the flames of hell in a breast where hitherto every
gentle feeling had resided.</p>

<p>The light talk of Crawford was soon confirmed in import
by the treatment which Bruce began to experience in society.
It was the fashion of the age that every injury,
however trifling, should be expiated by an ample revenge;
that nothing should be forgiven to any one, however previously
endeared. Accordingly, no distinction was made
between the case of Bruce and any other; no allowance
was made for the circumstances in which he stood respecting
the family of his injurer, nor for their former extraordinary
friendship. The public, with a feeling of which
too much still exists, seemed to think itself defrauded of
something which was its right, in the continued impunity
of Sackville’s insolence. It cried for blood to satisfy <em>itself</em>,
if not to restore the honour of the injured party. Bruce,
of course, suffered dreadfully from this sentiment wherever
he appeared; insomuch that, even though he might have
been still disposed to forgive his enemy, he saw that to do
so would only be to encounter greater misery than could
accrue from any attempt at revenge, even though that attempt
were certain to end in his own destruction.</p>

<p>It happened that just at this time Bruce and Sackville
had occasion, along with many other <em>attachés</em> of the court,
to attend the Elector Palatine out of the country, with his
newly-married bride, Elizabeth, the daughter of the king
and queen. The two young men kept apart till they came
to Canterbury, where, as the royal train was viewing the
cathedral, it chanced that they saw each other very near.
The elector, who knew a little of their story, immediately
called Sackville up to him, and requested his sword, enjoining
him, at the same time, in a friendly manner, to beware
of falling out with Bruce so long as he was in attendance
upon the court. His highness said, farther, that he had
heard his royal father-in-law speak of their quarrel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
express his resolution to visit any transgression of the laws
by either of them with his severest displeasure. Sackville
obeyed the command of the elector, and withdrew to a
part of the cortege remote from the place where Bruce was
standing. However, it happened, that, in surveying the
curiosities of that gorgeous architectural scene, they came
to the monument of a Scottish crusader, who had died here
on his way back from the Holy Land. Sackville muttered
something respecting this object, in which the words “beggarly
Scot” were alone overheard by Bruce, who stood at
no great distance, and who immediately recriminated by
using some corresponding phrase of obloquy applicable to
England, to which Sackville replied by striking his former
friend once more upon the face. Before another word or
blow could pass between them, a number of courtiers had
rushed forward to separate them, and they were immediately
borne back to a distance from each other, each, however,
glaring upon the other with a look of concentrated scorn
and hate. The elector thought it necessary, after what
had taken place, that they should be confined for a time
to their apartments. But no interval of time could restore
amity to those bosoms where formerly it had reigned
supreme. It was now felt by both that nothing but blood
could wipe out the sense of wrong which they mutually
felt; and, therefore, as the strictness of the king regarding
personal quarrels rendered it impossible to fight in Britain,
without danger of interruption, Bruce resolved to go beyond
seas, and thence send a challenge requesting Sackville to
follow him.</p>

<p>In forming this purpose, Bruce felt entirely like a doomed
man. He recollected the prediction of the old woman at
Culross Abbey, which had always appeared to him, somehow,
as implying that Sackville should be the unhappy
survivor. Already, he reflected, the least probable part
of the prediction had been fulfilled by their having quarrelled.
Under this impression, he found it indispensable
to his peace that he should return to London, and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
leave of two individuals in whom he felt the deepest
interest—his mother and his once-intended bride. Notwithstanding
the painful nature of his sensations, he found
it would be necessary to assume a forced ease of demeanour
in the presence of these beloved persons, lest he should
cause them to interpose themselves between him and his
purpose. The first visit was paid to his mother, who resided
at his own house. He had received, he said, some
news from Scotland, which rendered it necessary that he
should immediately proceed thither; and he briefly detailed
a story which he had previously framed in his own mind
for the purpose of deceiving her. After having made some
preparations for his journey, he came to take leave of her;
but his first precautions having escaped from his mind during
the interval, his forehead now bore a gloom as deep as the
shade of an approaching funeral. When his mother remarked
this, he explained it, not perfectly to her satisfaction,
but yet sufficiently so to avert farther question, by
reference to the pain of parting with his mistress on a long
and dangerous journey, when just about to be united to her
for life. As he pronounced the words “long and dangerous
journey,” his voice faltered with tenderness; but there was
so much truth in the real meaning of the phrase (however
little there might be now), that no metaphorical interpretation
occurred to the mind of Lady Bruce. He even spoke
of his will without exciting her suspicions. There was but
one point in it, he said, that he thought it worth while to
allude to. Wherever or whensoever it might please fate
to remove him from the coil of mortal life, he wished his
mother, or whoever might survive him, to recollect that
his dying spirit reverted to the scenes of his infancy, and
that his heart wished in life that it might never in death
be parted from that spot. These words, of course, communicated
to Lady Bruce’s spirit that gravity which the
mention of mortal things must ever carry; but yet nothing
seemed amiss in what she heard. It was not till after she
had parted with her son—not till she felt the blank impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of his last embrace lingering on her bosom, and thought
of him as an absent being, whom it would be long before she
saw again—that his final words had their full force upon
her mind. Those words, like a sweet tune heard in a crowd
with indifference, but which afterwards in solitude steals
into and melts the soul, then revived upon her mind, and
were pondered upon for days afterwards with a deep and
unaccountable sadness of spirit.</p>

<p>It now only remained that he should take leave of his
mistress. She was in the garden when he arrived, and no
sooner did she obtain a glimpse of his person, than she
ran gaily and swiftly towards him, with a face beaming with
joy, exclaiming that she had such good news to tell him as
he had not ever heard before. This turned out, upon
inquiry, to be the permission of her father that their nuptials
should take place that day month. The intelligence
fell upon Bruce’s heart like a stab, and it was some moments
ere he could collect himself to make an appropriate answer.
Lady Clementina observed his discomposure, and, with a
half-alarmed feeling, asked its cause. He explained it as
occasioned by regret for his necessary absence in Scotland,
to which he was called by some very urgent business, so
as to render it necessary that the commencement of their
mutual happiness should be put off for some time longer.
“Thus,” he said, “to be obstructed by an affair of my
own, after all the objections of others had been removed
with so much difficulty, is particularly galling.” The disappointment
of the young lady was more deeply felt than
it was strongly expressed. She was reassured, however,
by a fervent and solemn promise from her lover, that, as
soon as possible, he would return to make her his own.
After taking leave of her parents, he clasped her in one last
fond embrace, during which every moment seemed an age
of enjoyment, as if all the felicity of which he was about to
be defrauded had been concentrated and squandered in that
brief space. At one moment, he felt the warm pressure of
a being beloved above all earthly objects, and from whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
he had expected a whole life of happiness; at another, he
had turned away towards the emptiness of desolation, and
the cold breath of the grave.</p>

<p>One hour did he give to reflection upon all he left behind—an
hour such as those which sometimes turn men’s hair
gray—the next, and all after it, he devoted to the enterprise
upon which he was entering. Crawford, whom he requested
to become his second, readily agreed to accompany him
for that purpose; and they immediately set out for the
Netherlands, leaving a challenge for Sackville in the hands
of a friend, along with directions as to the proposed place
of meeting.</p>

<p>The remainder of this lamentable tale may be best told
in the words of Sir George Sackville. That unhappy
young man, some months after the fatal tragedy, wrote an
account of it to a friend, for the purpose of clearing himself
from certain aspersions which had been cast upon him. The
language is somewhat quaint, but it gives a more forcible
idea than could otherwise be conveyed of the frenzied
feelings of Bruce, under the wrongs which he had suffered
from his antagonist, as well as of the actual circumstances
of the combat.</p>

<p>“——We met at Tergosa, in Zealand, it being the
place allotted for rendezvous; he being accompanied with
one Mr Crawford, a Scotch gentleman, for his second, a
surgeon, and a man. There having rendered himself, I
addressed my second, Sir John Heidon, to let him understand
that now all following should be done by consent, as
concerning the terms whereon we should fight, as also the
place. To our seconds we gave power for their appointments,
who agreed we should go to Antwerp, from thence
to Bergen-op-Zoom, where in the midway but a village
divides the states’ territories from the archduke’s. And
there was the destined stage, to the end that, having
ended, he that could might presently exempt himself from
the justice of the country, by retiring into the dominion
not offended. It was farther concluded, that, in case any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
should fall or slip, that then the combat should cease, and
he whose ill-fortune had subjected him, was to acknowledge
his life to have been in the other’s hands. But in
case one party’s sword should break, because that could
only chance by hazard, it was agreed that the other should
take no advantage, but either then be made friends, or else
upon even terms go to it again. Thus these conclusions
being each of them related to his party, was by us both
approved, and assented to. Accordingly, we embarked
for Antwerp. And by reason, as I conceive, he could not
handsomely, without danger of discovery, had not paired
the sword I sent him to Paris; bringing one of the same
length, but twice as broad; my second excepted against it,
and advised me to match my own, and send him the choice,
which I obeyed; it being, you know, the privilege of the
challenged to elect his weapon. At the delivery of the
swords, which was performed by Sir John Heidon, it pleased
the Lord Bruce to choose my own, and then, past expectation,
he told him that a little of my blood would not
serve his turn; and, therefore, he was now resolved to
have me alone, because he knew (for I will use his own
words) ‘that so worthy a gentleman, and my friend, could
not endure to stand by and see him do that which he must,
to satisfy himself and his honour.’ Therefore, Sir John
Heidon replied, that such intentions were bloody and butcherly,
far unfitting so noble a personage, who should desire
to bleed for reputation, not for life; withal adding, he
thought himself injured, being come thus far, now to be
prohibited from executing those honourable offices he came
for. The lord, for answer, only reiterated his former resolutions;
whereupon Sir John, leaving him the sword he
had elected, delivered me the other, with his determinations.
The which, not for matter but manner, so moved me, as
though to my remembrance I had not for a long while eaten
more liberally than at dinner, and therefore unfit for such
an action (seeing the surgeons hold a wound upon the full
stomach more dangerous than otherwise), I requested my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
second to certify him I would presently decide the difference,
and therefore he should presently meet me on horseback,
only waited on by our surgeons, they being unarmed.
Together we rode, but one before the other some twelve
score paces, for about two English miles; and then passion
having so weak an enemy to assail as my discretion, easily
became the victor, and, using his power, made me obedient
to his commands. I being verily mad with anger that the
Lord Bruce should thirst after my life with a kind of assuredness,
seeing I had come so far and needlessly to give
him leave to regain his lost reputation, I bade him alight,
which with willingness he quickly granted, and there in a
meadow, ancle deep in water at the least, bidding farewell
to our doublets, in our shirts began to charge each other;
having afore commanded our surgeons to withdraw themselves
a pretty distance from us, conjuring them, besides,
as they respected our favours, or their own safeties, not to
stir, but suffer us to execute our pleasure; we being fully
resolved (God forgive us!) to dispatch each other by what
means we could. I made a thrust at my enemy, but was
short, and, in drawing back my arm, I received a great
wound thereon, which I interpreted as a reward for my
short shooting; but in my revenge, I pressed into him,
though I then missed him also, and received a wound in
my right pap, which passed level through my body, and
almost to my back. And there we wrestled for the two
greatest and dearest prizes we could ever expect trial for—honour
and life. In which struggling, my hand, having
but an ordinary glove upon it, lost one of her servants,
though the meanest. But at last breathless, yet keeping
our hold, there passed on both sides propositions of quitting
each other’s swords. But when amity was dead,
confidence could not live, and who should quit first was the
question, which on neither part either would perform; and
restriving again afresh, with a kick and a wrench I freed
my long captive weapon, which incontinently levying at
his throat, being master still of his, I demanded if he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
ask his life, or yield his sword, both which, though in that
imminent danger, he bravely denied to do. Myself being
wounded, and feeling loss of blood, having three conduits
running on me, which began to make me faint, and he
courageously persisting not to accede to either of my propositions,
through remembrance of his former bloody desire,
and feeling of my present estate, I struck at his heart,
but, with his avoiding, missed my aim, yet passed through
the body, and drawing out my sword, repassed it again
through another place, when he cried, ‘Oh! I am slain!’
seconding his speech with all the force he had to cast me.
But being too weak, after I had defended his assault, I
easily became master of him, laying him on his back—when
being upon him, I redemanded if he would request his life;
but it seemed he prized it not at so dear a rate to be beholden
for it, bravely replying, ‘He scorned it.’ Which
answer of his was so noble and worthy, as I protest I
could not find in my heart to offer him any more violence,
only keeping him down until at length his surgeon afar off
cried, ‘He would immediately die, if his wounds were not
stopped.’ Whereupon I asked if he desired his surgeon
should come, which he accepted of; and so, being drawn
away, I never offered to take his sword, accounting it
inhuman to rob a dead man, for so I held him to be. This
thus ended, I retired to my surgeon, in whose arms, after
I had remained a while, for want of blood, I lost my sight,
and withal, as I then thought, my life also. But strong
water and his diligence quickly recovered me; when I
escaped a great danger; for my lord’s surgeon, when
nobody dreamt of it, came full at me with his lord’s sword;
and had not mine with my sword interposed himself, I had
been slain by those base hands; although my Lord Bruce,
weltering in his blood, and past all expectation of life, conformable
to all his former carriage, which was undoubtedly
noble, cried out, ‘Rascal, hold thy hand!’ So may I prosper,
as I have dealt sincerely with you in this relation.</p>

<p>“Louvain, September 8, 1613.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Such is the melancholy story of Edward Lord Bruce, a
young nobleman, who, but for a false point of honour,
arising from the incorrect judging of the world, might have
lived to make many fellow-creatures happy, and adorn the
annals of his country. The sacred griefs of those to whom
he was most peculiarly endeared, it would be vain to paint.
A mistress who wore mourning, and lived single for his sake
all the rest of her life—a mother, who survived him only
to mourn his irreparable loss—upon such holy sorrow it is
not for me to intrude. It may be only mentioned, that the
latter individual, recollecting the last parting words of her
son, caused his heart to be embalmed, and brought to her in
a silver case (the body being buried in the cathedral of Bergen-op-Zoom),
and carried it with her to Culross, where
she spent the remainder of her life in gloomy solitude, with
that object always before her upon her table. After her
death, it was deposited in the family vault already described,
where it has ever since remained, the best monument of
its own fatal history.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CULTIVATIONS">CULTIVATIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">All men are not agriculturists, horticulturists, or arboriculturists;
but yet almost all men are <em>cultivators</em>. By this it
is meant that men in general cultivate, or coax, or unduly
appreciate and fondle, some particular feature of their persons,
or else, perhaps, some integument connected with
their persons, to such a degree as to be rather conspicuous,
while to every thing else they only give the ordinary degree
of attention. There are many features of human nature
which remain to be detected and described; and this is
one—<em>Cultivations</em>. So far as I am aware, no one ever
thought of pointing it out to mankind: the subject of cultivation
has hitherto remained totally <em>uncultivated</em>. So it
shall be no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Hair, as the only part of the person which actually grows
like a vegetable, is naturally a large subject of cultivation.
The Cavaliers long ago cultivated love-locks, which they
kept hanging down in graceful fashion from their temples.
These locks, or curls, are now changed for tufts or bunches
of hair, which the young men cultivate at the same place,
and are ever shaking up and tedding, exactly as if it were
a crop of hay instead of hair. Mark a modern beau as
he walks along the street, and you will observe at one
glance that the principal part of the man—the heart—the
sensorium—the cynosure—the point from which all the
rest evolves—the root of the man, in short, is the tuft under
the right rim of his hat. All the rest of him is a mere
pendulum, vibrating from this axis. As he walks along, he
hardly feels that any other part of him is in existence, besides
that. But he feels his tuft most intensely. Thought,
feeling, every thing, lies concentrated in that: head, body,
and limbs, are all alike mere members devolved from it.
If you were to cut off the side-bunch of a modern beau in
his sleep, he would, for the time, be utterly ruined. It
would be like the polypus, deprived of every thing but a
single leg; and he would require several months of dormant
existence—that is, retirement from the streets—to
let the better part of him grow out again from the worse,
which had remained behind. Let not the demure Puritan,
however, think that the joke lies all against the gay Cavalier
or beau. There may be as much of the sin of cultivation in
the stroked and glossy hair of the Roundhead or <em>plain man</em>,
as in the love-locks and bunches of their antipodes in sentiment.
I have seen some men, who affected to be very
unaffected, cultivate a peak on the top and centre of their
brows as sedulously, and with as much inward gratulation
on account of it, as ever I saw a dandy cultivate a tuft, or
train a side-curl. It must be understood that there are
cultivations of a negative character, as well as of a positive,
and he who is guiltless of cultivation in his heart is
alone guiltless. Next to curls stand whiskers. What a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
field of cultivation have we there! The whisker is a
bounty of nature, which man does not like to refuse taking
advantage of. The thing presses upon him—it is <em>there</em>;
and to put it altogether aside, except upon the demand of
temporary fashion, is scarcely to be thought of. Some
men, however, are more able to resist the demon of whiskers
than others. There are some men so prone to the
temptations of this fiend, that they enlarge and enlarge
their field of cultivation, by small and imperceptible degrees,
till at length the whole chin falls a prey, excepting,
perhaps, a small bit about the mouth, just enough to preserve
the cultivator within the pale of the Christian church.
Sometimes the Whisker Fiend makes an insidious advance
or sally up towards the corners of the mouth; and there—in
those small creeks or promontories—does the sin of
cultivation invariably flourish more proud and rampant than
any where else. The whisker of the cheek is a broad,
honest, candid, downright cultivation, but that down
about the corners of the mouth is a sly and most impish
one—a little pet sin, apt to beset its cultivator in a far less
resistible fashion than any other; and it may indeed be
said, that he who has given himself fairly up to this crime
is almost beyond redemption.</p>

<p>There are some men who cultivate white hands, with
long fair nails. For nothing else do they care very particularly—all
is well, if only their hands be neat. There
is even a ridiculous notion that elegant hands are the most
unequivocal test of what is called good birth. I can say,
for my own part, that the finest hands I ever saw belonged
to a woman who kept a butcher’s shop in Musselburgh.
So much for the nonsense about fine hands. Then there
is a set of people who cultivate a ring on a particular finger—evidently
regretting, from their manner of managing it,
that the South Sea fashion of wearing such ornaments
in the nose has not ever come into this country. Some
men cultivate neat ebony canes with golden heads, which,
they tell you, cost a guinea. Some cultivate a lisp. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
few, who fall under the denomination of stout gentlemen,
rejoice in a respectable swell of the haunch, with three
wrinkles of the coat lying upon it in majestic repose.
Some cultivate a neckcloth—some a shirt-breast—some a
jewelled pin, with a lesser pin at a little distance, which
serves to it as a kind of anchor. There has also of late
been a great fashion of cultivating chains about the waistcoat.
Some only show about two inches of a gold or silver
one between the buttons and the pocket; others, less
modest, have themselves almost laced round and round
with this kind of tracery. There is also to be detected,
occasionally, a small patch of cultivation in the shape of a
curious watch-key or seal, which depends from part of the
chain, and is evidently a great pet. A not uncommon
subject of cultivation is a gold watch.</p>

<p>There is a class who cultivate silk umbrellas. It is a prevalent
idea among many men that a silk umbrella is an exceedingly
<em>genteel</em> thing. They therefore have an article of this
kind, which they are always carrying in a neat careful manner,
so as to show that it is silk. They seem to feel as if they
thought all right when they have their silk umbrella in their
hand: it is a kind of patent of respectability. With a silk
umbrella they could meet the highest personages in the land,
and not be abashed. A silk umbrella is, indeed, a thing
of such vast effect, that they would be content to go in
humble guise in every other respect, provided they only
had this saving clause to protect them. Nay, it is not too
much to suppose them entertaining this belief, that five-and-twenty
shillings put forth on a good silk umbrella produces
as much value in dignity as five pounds spent upon
good broad-cloth. How some men do fondle and cultivate
silk umbrellas!</p>

<p>There is a species of cultivators who may in some cases
be very respectable, and entitled to our forbearance, but
are, in others, worthy of a little ridicule. I mean the health-seekers;
the men who go out at five in the morning to
cultivate an appetite, and regularly chill every sharp-set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
evening party they attend, by sitting like Melancholy retired,
ostentatiously insisting that they “never take supper.”
When a health-seeker takes a walk, he keeps his coat wide
open, his vest half open—seems, in short, to woo the contact
of the air—and evidently regrets very much that he
cannot enjoy it in the manner of a bath. As he proceeds,
he consumes air, as a steam-boat consumes coal; insomuch
that, when he leaves the place, you would actually think the
atmosphere has a fatigued and exhausted look, as if the whole
oxygen had been absorbed to supply his individual necessities.
Wherever this man goes, the wind rises behind
him, by reason of the vacuum which he has produced. He
puffs, pants, fights, strives, struggles for health. When
he returns from his morning walk, he first looks in the glass
to congratulate himself on the bloom which he has been
cultivating in his cheek, and thereafter sits down to solace
the appetite which he finds he has nursed into a kind of
fury. At any ordinary time, he could spring from his bed at
nine o’clock, and devour four cups of tea, with bread, ham,
eggs, and haddocks, beyond reckoning. But he thinks it
necessary to walk four hours, for the purpose of enabling
himself to take eight cups, and a still more unconscionable
proportion of bread, ham, eggs, and haddocks. He may be
compared, in some measure, to the fat oxen which are
sometimes shown about as wonders, though apparently
there is nothing less wonderful, the obvious natural means
being taken. These oxen, if left to themselves in a good
park, would become very respectable oxen—a little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en-bon-point</i>,
perhaps, but no more. But, being treated otherwise,
they are rendered unnecessarily fat and unwieldy; and so it
is with the appetite of the health cultivator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cultivations</span>, it will thus be observed, is a subject of
vast extent, and of great importance, not only to the
<em>landed</em> interest, but to all the other interests of the country.
I should be glad to treat it at full length in a separate volume,
for which, I doubt not, ample materials might be
found. But I must content myself with giving it in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
meantime only a kind of topping, as the farmers say; and
perhaps I may return to it next harvest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="FITS_OF_THRIFT">FITS OF THRIFT.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Nothing is more common in the middle ranks of life than
to find housewives taking what may be called <em>fits of thrift</em>.
Though sensible women in their way, excellent advisers
and charming gossips, and though by no means spenders
on a great scale, they have no enduring principle of economy,
but are only frugal by fits and starts. They take
qualms of thriftiness now and then—sometimes from reading
a string of plausible receipts for cookery on a cheap
scale, or from being struck with the excellent arrangements
in the household of a friend, who tells her that, by managing
in such and such a manner, salting all her own beef, and
making all her own preserves, she has, one way and another,
saved a good deal of money, which is really a thing
of some consequence in these bad times, when so little is
coming in. This chronic frugality is common to single
ladies, under as well as above one-and-twenty, and to
married ladies with large families. The fits have different
tendencies, although the prevailing symptoms are the same.
Occasionally the furor seizes one single young lady in a
family of sisters; and I have seen that it comes on most
commonly in the spring. In such cases the disease perhaps
takes the direction of butter and eggs. Some day
about the month of April or May, and when breakfast is on
the table, the young lady begins to make observations on
the dearth and rancidity of the butter. “I declare for my
part,” says she, “we have been poisoned for the last six
months with that stuff that we get from the woman who
keeps the little shop in the area on the opposite side of the
street. You know it was only out of pity to her when her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
husband was burnt to death at the distillery, that we said
that we would take some small things from her; but you
see she does not keep wholesome articles; and really, in
my opinion, it is high time we were looking about for something
we can trust to.” With this sort of discourse the
young notable opens the plan of her campaign. She says
she is resolved to rise every morning at seven, and go with
a basket herself to the market. The mornings, she says,
are now greatly lengthened out, and, besides saving a penny
a pound on the butter, and getting a better article, she is
confident the walk will prove of great benefit to her health.
It may always be observed, that the husband, father, or
elder brother of the notable, never makes any objections
when such schemes of saving are propounded. They know
intuitively that the whole is a delusion, which will work itself
off in a week or two; that the same disease has visited
the family once every year about the same period ever
since they can recollect, and that it will now, as formerly,
only furnish a little harmless temporary excitement in the
house. Armed with a negative approval from these relations,
together with a pound note, the young notable starts
next Saturday morning between seven and eight o’clock;
and after taking half an hour to array herself in an undress,
studiously selecting for the occasion a shabbyish shawl,
and a pair of shoes that she puts on, only on “bad days,”
also a straw bonnet faded both in the material and in the
riband, she sallies forth with her basket to the market.
With what an air of knowingness she goes from cart to
cart, examining, and tasting, and smelling their contents!
How she tries to elicit, by cross-questioning the man in
the sky-blue coat, or the blowsky girl in the dimity head-gear,
sitting amidst their savoury boxes with leather hinges,
every particular in the history of the butter; where and
when it was made, and why it happens to be up this morning,
and so forth. How she wanders amidst the egg women,
holding up the eggs between her and the light, asking if
they be sure they are not Orkney eggs, and what their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
probable age may be? What with toiling up and down
the market for three quarters of an hour, and beating down
the prices in a most exemplary manner, she at last accomplishes
her purchases, and brings home her cargo of native
produce. When you come down to breakfast, you will be
at once reminded of what has been going on, by the air of
superiority and triumph assumed by Miss Notable. She
thinks that by rising an hour sooner than any body else,
and saving, as she thinks, the sum of twopence, she has
purchased the character of a thrifty personage, and, consequently,
is entitled to look down upon the whole house.
There is no end to her account of how she managed to find
out the best butter in the cart, and how she higgled the
man out of a halfpenny in the pound. When she places
a slice of this extraordinary butter before you, she takes
care to show you how fresh the colour is, and waits with
impatience to hear your expected, and not to be dispensed
with, praise of its taste. The butter she has bought is, in
fact, her pet for the whole week. She considers it as her
butter: and if any visitor slight it, by not paying it the
necessary compliments, he is of course not indebted to her
for any future invitation to the house.</p>

<p>A fit of thrift of this nature lasts generally three or four
weeks, seldom more. I have seen it continue a fortnight
in tolerable strength; it then declines, and wears off towards
the fourth Saturday. The decline of this household
disease is as amusing in its way as its increase. The young
lady begins to find, that, so far from improving her health
or strength by such morning exercise, she only “makes
herself out,” and is unfit to do any thing else the whole
day. And then it is, after all, only to save a few halfpence.
She also finds that her purchases do not always turn well
out, and that she cannot coax her father, or the rest of
them, to be perpetual admirers of her butter and eggs. As
a get-off, she commences an eulogy on her butter, which,
she says, is sold by a man in Rose Street—a person who
was once a farmer, but was reduced by misfortunes to open a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
small shop in the town, and sell dairy produce. This man
she says, is <em>experienced</em> in butter, and imports every week
as much as will serve a dozen families. She has made interest
with him through the servant to be counted one of his
regular customers, and he will supply the family at all times
exactly at the market price, not a farthing more. This new
plan helps greatly as a solace to the conscience in abandoning
her morning airings with her basket and dishabille; and
so she gradually subsides into the ordinary routine of domestic
arrangements.</p>

<p>The married notable is subject to fits of thrift in a greater
or less degree about the months of October and November.
Some day at dinner, when there happens to be rather
a poorish leg of lamb on the table, and not much else, she
opens her attack by saying, in a peevishly authoritative
manner, that really the family has been long enough on
fresh meat; that, for her part, the lamb that they have
had so often does not agree with her, and that she would
rather prefer a good salt herring. “Mrs Lockhart has
just been telling me that the doctor has advised them to
eat twice or thrice a-week a piece of salt meat—that is to
say, a piece of beef newly powdered, just the fresh taste
off it, and hardly having the appearance of the saltpetre at
the bone; and I <em>do</em> think that we cannot do better than
just follow such a sensible man’s advice, and get two or
three pieces next Wednesday for salting—you know it will
be a great saving of money.” The drift of all this is, that
the husband shall forthwith exhibit on the table a couple
of twenty shilling notes; but as he knows that these handy
pieces of paper are sometimes not very easily got, he perhaps
tries to throw an obstacle or two in the way of the
salting project, and, for instance, mentions that his wife has
no convenience for curing beef. “You observe,” says he,
“it requires a tub, or something of that sort, and, besides,
there is a great knack in curing the meat thoroughly; and
if you do not take care, you will spoil the whole.” As a
matter of course, these or similar observations cannot hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
good in the face of a wife under a fit of thrift. All you
can say is borne down, and the money is at length consigned
with a groan to the steel purse of the good lady,
who, next day—for she is in the fidgets till her purpose is
executed—sets out in her muff and shawl (the first time for
the season) on an expedition, first to lay in her beef, and
then to buy a sufficient and commodious <em>salting can</em>. Well,
the <em>can</em>, that darling object of a notable’s ambition, <em>is</em> purchased.
The beef <em>is</em> salted; and the goodman and his
family are shortly put on salt meat, whether they like such
fare or otherwise. The thrifty lady all this time takes
care, on every occasion, to show off her beef as well worthy
of being tasted by visitors; and the short and long of it is,
that the said beef is eaten up in half the time it is expected
to last; fresh meat begins to show itself more
frequently at your table, and the fit is put aside till another
opportunity occurs of playing it off.</p>

<p>These are very ordinary instances of fits of thrift, but
there are hundreds of the same description which I could
mention. Sometimes the fit takes the direction of a new
gown for going out with on bad days, to save others of a
better sort; at another time it is “a house gown,” as “really
my best black silk one is absolutely getting wasted with
having to go so often into the kitchen.” Occasionally it is
the hiring of two maid-servants, “so that the washings
need not any longer be given out;” at other times it is the
buying of a crumb-cloth, to save the carpet, or the purchasing
of loads of old china and crockery at auctions. I
have seen all the ladies in the house manifest this frenzy
by working their own lace, or painting pictures which had
to be hung in dear gilded frames. Again, I have noticed
it in great vigour in a family in town resolving to have a
garden, so as to grow their own vegetables. It comes on
very frequently in a desire to dye old ribands, or feathers,
or “dress” shawls; in which case the lady who is affected
sets out on a voyage of discovery through all the obscure
courts and alleys about the town, seeking for some old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
woman whom they have heard of as being “the best” at
these processes of renovation. It may be remarked, that
the fit visits the nation, like an epidemic, towards the end
of July. Almost every house in the kingdom is then thrown
into an uproar by the ladies, young and old, confederating
to manufacture gooseberry jam or currant jelly. Such a
requisition is there then in all quarters for “brass pans,”
and such a deal of money is spent in this popular confectionary!
At the approach and during the continuance of
the epidemic, the husbands very wisely make no remonstrance,
well knowing that such would be utterly thrown
away. “You know, my dear,” would say the thrifty spouse,
“we shall require at least two dozen pints this season; for
nothing is more useful in a house, in case of colds; and
you will remember how much good a spoonful or two did
little George last February, when we thought he was going
to take the fever; indeed, the doctor said it had been the
very saving of his life.” Nothing, of course, can withstand
an appeal to such authority; so the money is disbursed
for the purchase of the fruit and other materials, although
the goodman never can exactly see now some pounds’
worth of jelly should be laid up in store, all for the sake
of needing two tea-spoonfuls.</p>

<p>Sometimes the family is so unfortunate as to get an oven,
and a particularly economical Miss undertakes to bake what
is called family bread. A great saving is expected from
this source; but it soon turns out that so much of the
article is given away to friends, as a kind of curiosity, or to
impress them with a sense of the economy practised in the
house, that a great deal more is lost than gained by the
novelty. In fact, it always turns out, as in the case of the
Vicar of Wakefield and his thrice notable spouse, that
these chronic economists are not observed to make their
husbands any richer by their contrivances, so much is lost
by the expense of the experiment, compared with what is
gained by the short duration of the practice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUSAN_HAMILTON">SUSAN HAMILTON,<br>
<span class="fs80">A TALE OF VILLAGE LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The village of Daldaff lay in a nook of the hills, in one of
the most rural districts of Scotland. Far from any of the
great thoroughfares, or any of the large manufacturing
towns, it continued, down even to the beginning of the present
century, to be one of the most entire specimens in
existence of all that a Scotch village used to be. Its situation
was a deep hollow, upon the banks of a mountain
stream, and it looked from some points of view as if a parcel
of children’s toy-houses had been shaken promiscuously
in a bowl, and suddenly fixed in the way they happened to
arrange themselves at the bottom. It was all a confused
mixture of gray old walls and brown thatch, with green
gardens, and arbours, and mountain-ash trees. When
you looked down from any of the surrounding heights, you
wondered how communication was carried on amongst
neighbours, or how strangers found an entrance into the
village; for you saw no trace of streets, paths, or ways.
It was only when you descended into the place, that you
saw here and there a narrow road threading its way among
the houses, somewhat after the manner of the puzzle called
the walls of Troy. Most of the little dwellings had a long
stripe of garden, running from behind them up the hill;
other houses had their sides or backs placed close against
the bank, so that you might have walked off the ground
upon their roofs without perceiving it—while the gardens
spread downwards before them, like aprons. These gardens
bore large beds of refulgent cabbages, with gooseberry
bushes between; and always in some sunny and sheltered
place there were a few bee-hives, the tops of which were
kept warm either with a crown of straw or a mantle of turf.
At morning hour you would have seen the honest weavers,
who peopled most of the houses, busying themselves in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
delving and dibbling in these little patches of ground.
During the long day, perhaps nothing of life was to be seen
about them, except the circumspect and decent hen walking
up the avenue with her chirping brood, or the cock
flapping his wings from the top of the wall, and crowing a
defiance to some distant foe of his own kind: or the bees,
as they one by one made themselves visible out of the
universal sunniness, in the immediate shadow of the hive.
At night, however, the weaver would be seen walking forth
with his pipe in his mouth, his Kilmarnock cowl brushed
back from his forehead, and his clothes loose at the knees,
to observe the growth of the berries, or pull a bunch of
lily-oak for his children, who came prattling behind him;
or to hold converse through the evening stillness with a
neighbour perhaps four gardens off, respecting the last proceedings
of “that dreedfu’ fallow, Bonyparty.” When
standing in the centre of the village, you might have almost
been persuaded that there was no other place in the world.
The rim of the horizon was within two hundred yards of
the eye all round, and nothing besides was to be seen but
the contracted sky. On the top of the bank, in one direction,
stood the church, with its little docked steeple, and its
body-guard of old trees. In another direction there was a
peep of the turrets of an old half-ruined mansion-house,
which had not been occupied for many years, except by the
spirit of a murdered man, which was understood to occupy
a particular room, and always went by the horribly descriptive
name of <em>Spotty</em>. Beyond the edge of the surrounding
banks, the country swept downwards in extensive flats,
generally sterile, but here and there showing fine spots of
pastoral green. Over these downs, groups of children
would sometimes be seen rambling hand in hand, in those
adventurous journeys of half a mile from home, which children
are so fond of taking; sometimes talking to each other
of the novelties of the created world, which were every
now and then striking their eyes and their imaginations;
at other times pondering in silent and infantine abstraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
on the beauty of the gowans which grew by their sides,
and in the bosoms of which, as they gazed into them, they
saw, reflected as in a mirror, their own fairness and innocence.
There, also, while the wind even of summer carried
its chill, the little neat-herd boy would be seen sitting on the
leeward side of the green knoll, with his sister by his side,
and a plaid drawn all around them, their arms laced round
each other’s necks, and their cheeks laid close together, as
both read from the same tattered story book, or partook of
the same pease-bread and milk, which served as their afternoon
meal. Within the village all was primeval simplicity.
The houses already mentioned were arranged without the
least regard to each other’s convenience—some back to
back, some shoulder to shoulder, but as generally front to
back, and shoulder to front. The white manse sat half
way up the bank, overlooking the whole, like an idol presiding
over a crowded group of worshippers. On what
might be considered the principal thoroughfare in the village,
stood the inn, a house distinguished from all the rest,
by its being two stories in height, not to speak of the still
more remarkable distinction of a hanging sign, on which was
painted something dark and grim, meant for a black bull,
besides the frequent apparition of a carrier’s cart resting
with its beams high and rampant into the air. Another
house, rather better than the rest, was occupied by “a
merchant,” a man originally a haberdashery pedlar, but
who, having here at last set up his ellwand of rest, dealt
not only in women’s attire, but in a thousand things else
besides, as if he had been</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Not one, but all <em>shopkeepers’</em> epitome.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Then there was the modest tenement of Luckie Smytrie,
with its window of four panes, showing to the passing
traveller two biscuits on edge, and as many dark green
bottles filled with comfits; while within, if you had chosen
to enter, you would have found at one end of the room in
which the decent woman lived, a large cupboard and a
small table forming her mercantile establishment for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
sale of all kinds of small wares. Were you to lounge a
little in this humble retreat of commerce, you might see
children coming in every now and then asking for such
things as an ounce of soap, a quarter of an ounce of tea,
a halfpenny-worth of whipcord, or, perhaps (what would
astonish you most of all), change of a penny—viz. two
halfpence. Luckie Smytrie was a woman who had experienced
great trials in early life, had had husbands killed
by accidents, sons enlisted for soldiers and slain in battle,
and daughters that died in the morn and liquid dew of youth,
innumerable. Her shop was therefore patronised by all
the villagers, to the prejudice, in some articles, of the more
ambitious establishment of the retired packman; but yet
the old woman, like all shopkeepers who have little rivalry,
was as much offended at losing any partial or occasional
custom in favour of that individual, as if she had had a far
stronger and more prescriptive right to the business of the
place. For instance, you might see a boy come in with a
small cotton handkerchief in his hand, and say that his
mother had sent him for a halfpenny-worth of thread,
matching with that piece of attire, which she wished to
hem. To which Mrs Smytrie would respond, in a cool
voice, but intended to convey the most cutting sarcasm,
“Gang back, hinny, and tell your mother that it would be
far better to get her thread where she got her napkin.”
Or, perhaps, it was an order for bread on a Sunday evening,
from some one who had had an unexpected crowd of visitors
at tea. The request was then put in the following terms:—“Mrs
Smytrie [on other occasions it was plain Tibbie],
my mother has her compliments t’ye, and she wad be
muckle obleeged for twa tippeny bricks (loaves), as there’s
some folk come upon her to their four-hours that she didna
expeck.” To the which Mrs Smytrie would answer, in
the same cruelly tranquil voice, “Tell your mother, my
woman, that she had better get her bread on the Sabbath
night where she gets’t on the Saturday’t e’en,” well knowing
all the while that the shop referred to was not open,
and that there was no other besides her own in the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
village, or within ten miles round. Perhaps a child would
come in for a halfpenny-worth of paper, namely, writing-paper;
but Mrs Smytrie, mistaking the word, would set
about the elaborate ceremony of weighing out what she
supposed the required quantity of pepper. The boy would
look on, not knowing what to think of it, till at last he was
roused from his reverie by having a neat little conical
parcel, with a twist at the point, presented to him instead
of the roll of paper which he had expected. He would
then murmur out, with a ludicrous mixture of stupidity and
terror, “It was paper I was wanting;” at which the old
widow would break out with the anticipated torrent of invective,
“Hech! dyted thing, could ye no speak plainer?
What for did ye let me be makin’ up the pepper for ye,
and no tell me it was paper? Niff-naffin!” There was
hardly any other house in the village in the least distinguished
from its fellows. The most of them were occupied
by a race of decent weavers—for this, indeed, was the
staple employment of Daldaff. Through almost every
lattice you heard the constant sound of the shuttle and lay,
mixed with the voices of the honest operatives, as they sung
at their work. In a preceding age, the village contained
only three or four of this class of men, who employed themselves
in weaving the homely woollen cloth and sheeting
which were then used by the country people, being formed
out of materials supplied immediately by themselves. But
these kinds of manufacture had, in a great measure, given
way in favour of the lighter <em>fabrics</em> of Glasgow. Cottons
were now supplied from that immense mart, to be woven
into showy webs; and as the trade offered far superior
remuneration to what had ever been known in the village,
not only the old serge-weavers had changed the one employment
for the other, but a vast flock of their sons and connexions,
and many of the country people around, had rushed
into it, so that the primitive little village of Daldaff became
neither more nor less than a kind of colony or dependency
of the great western capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>This revolution was at first productive of a great increase
of comfort in the village, without materially altering the
primeval virtues of its inhabitants. Old men began to lay
by blue bonnets in favour of hats. A few old hereditary
black coats, which had been worn from youth to age, were
at last rescued from the twilight of a Sabbath fame, and consigned
ungrudgingly to a general use throughout the week.
Young men began to abandon hodden gray for Galashiels
blue; young women got straw bonnets to cover locks heretofore
exposed in cockernonnies, and there were two if not
three green gauze veils in the village. In respect of domestic
economy, almost every housewife had the pot on
three times a-week, so that third day’s kail was beginning
to be a thing almost unknown. Tea was also intruding its
outlandish face into scenes where bread and milk was erst
the only luxury. Some of the husbands held long out
against it, but at length they almost all sneaked into a liking
for it, and no more thought of wanting it at the end of their
day’s work, than they thought of wanting their halesome
porridge at the beginning. It was sometimes lamented by
the excellent old minister, that family worship was a usage
not favoured by this change of circumstances; but still,
both at nine in the morning, and about the same hour in
the evening, you might have heard, in passing some of the
houses, either the rude and tremulous psalmody raised by
the father of the household, or the low and earnest prayer
which he was pouring forth, with his knees and those of
all his family resting upon his clay floor. Then all the good
old sports were kept up. The boys, instead of being confined,
like those of larger manufacturing towns, in unhealthy
cotton mills, were permitted at all hours, except those during
which they were engaged at school, to play at the golf
and shinty, or at bows and arrows, upon the common haugh
by the burn side, or else to roam farther a-field in search
of birds’ nests, or to harry the crows in the woods. On
the same haugh, in the summer evenings, after work was
done, the young men would be seen “putting the stane,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
or playing at “the pennystanes” (quoits), or perhaps amusing
themselves with the more energetic game of football,
while their cowled fathers would walk forth to sympathise
in and judge of their feats, and enjoy a hearty unmeasured
laugh at every unharming “mischanter” which might befall
them. Thither also would repair the trig shortgowned
lass, just newly “redd up,” as she would style it, her curls
shining in their recent release from paper, over a face to
which a good washing had lent a richer glow, and her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout-ensemble</i>
in every respect greatly improved—as female figures,
somehow or other, always are—by being seen in the declining
light of the golden eve. There, while the young
of the different sexes interchanged their joke and their gibe,
and the old raised the still heartier laugh at every feat in the
game, and children shouted and dogs barked from the mere
contagion of joy, while, moreover, the sun sent his last rich
rays through the trees above the village, whence the</p>

<p>Many villages in Scotland enjoy a humble local fame for
some particular custom or sport, which is understood to
reign there in supremacy over all others. If Daldaff was
celebrated for any form of fun more than another, it was
for curling—a sport peculiar to Scotland, and which may
be best described to southern readers, by the simple statement,
that it employs large smooth stones upon the ice,
much after the manner of bowls upon a bowling-green.
The game can only be practised after a very hard frost, as
it requires the strongest ice to bear the numbers who usually
assemble either to play or look on. Curling is a game
relished so keenly in Scotland, that, like other common
appetites, it levels all distinctions of station and rank. In
a rural and thinly-peopled district like that around Daldaff,
the laird might be seen mingling with not only his farmers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
but his cottagers, interchanging the broad jest at his own
failures, and giving applause wherever it was due. The
minister might also be seen driving his stone with as much
anxiety of eye as any one, and occasionally, perhaps, envying
the good fortune of an unlettered peasant, whom, on
another occasion, he would have to chide for his backwardness
in the Single Catechism. Daldaff was fortunately
situated for this game, as, less than a mile below the village,
the mountain stream spread out into a little lake sufficient
to have afforded room for half a dozen “rinks.” There
one Saturday afternoon the people of Daldaff had a <em>bonspiel</em>,
or grand contest, with the inhabitants of the adjacent parish
of Sarkinholm, who had long disputed with them the palm
of superiority. A bonspiel is not appointed to take place
every day; neither is Saturday like any other day of the
week. Hence, although an unfortunate thaw was just
commencing, the disputants resolved to have out their
game, trusting that the ice would at least last long enough
to do their turn. Notwithstanding the unfavourable state
of the ice, the bonspiel passed off with great eclat. Nearly
all Daldaff and Sarkinholm were collected to witness the
sport; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">certaminis gaudia</i>, or joys of the combat,
were felt perhaps as keenly in the hearts of the women and
children of these respective places, as in those of the curlers
themselves. Before the game was done, the men were
standing inch deep in water, and the stones, as they came
up to the rink, sent the spray high into the air before them,
like shavings from a joiner’s plane. The short day of January
was also drawing very near to a close, and a deep
dark cloud had settled down upon the mountains to the
west, betokening a thorough change in the weather. At
length victory declared itself in favour of Daldaff, and the
parties “quat their roaring play,” to betake themselves to
their respective homes. All in a short time had left the
place, except a small band of boys and girls, who continued
to enjoy a pair of slides on a somewhat higher and drier
part of the ice.</p>

<p>The rivulet connected with this little lake was one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
those which, rising in a large basin of hilly country, are
liable to be swelled occasionally in a very short space of
time, so that, though at one hour they may scarcely show
a rill among the channel-stones, they are the next raging
like a large and impetuous river. On the present occasion,
being fed by the cloud just spoken of, it came down in one
of its most awful forms, and in one instant broke up the
ice upon the peaceful lake with a noise like thunder. The
children who had been sliding, though they scarcely had a
moment of warning, escaped from the ice—all except one,
Susan Hamilton, the daughter of the leading manufacturer
in the village. She had been the last to approach a gulf
which had been leaped by all the rest, and, her heart failing
her at the moment, she was immediately carried off
from the land upon a large board of ice. What had lately
been the solid surface of the lake was now gathered in a
large glacier of peaky fragments at the bottom, while all
around the water was extending far beyond its usual limits.
Susan Hamilton was soon drifted down to this mass of ice,
where, from the top of a lofty pinnacle, she cried loudly
for help, which, however, was every moment becoming
more difficult to be rendered. The most of her companions
had fled in childish terror to the village; but as the
danger was instant, there seemed little chance of rescue
from that quarter. Fortunately a young man who had
accompanied some friends to Sarkinholm happened to be
returning to Daldaff, and, hearing cries of distress, rushed
up to the spot. Though the twilight was now deepening,
he perceived the situation of the child, and being perfectly
acquainted with the ground, he immediately resolved upon a
plan of rescue. A large board of ice happened to be lying in
a creek near the place where he stood. Upon this he fearlessly
embarked, and, guiding it by means of his curling-brush,
he soon reached the iceberg to which Susan Hamilton was
clinging. Having prevailed upon her to leap down into
his arms, he placed her carefully on board his icy raft, and
then steered back towards the shore, where by this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
a few of the villagers, including the child’s father, were
collected. He was so fortunate as to return in safety, and
had the satisfaction—which Bishop Burnet considered to
be the greatest on earth—of rendering a man truly happy.
The joy of the father was speechless; but the other villagers
raised a shout of admiration in honour of his heroic conduct.
Nor was the general feeling abated, when, immediately
after he had regained the shore, the vast glacier,
loosed from its confinement at the bottom of the lake, was
precipitated down the channel of the stream, where it tumbled
and dashed along with the resistless force of rocks
thrown down a hill-side, and the noise of a hurricane in a
forest. It was seen that if he had hesitated but for a minute
to adventure upon his perilous task, the child must
have perished, almost before her father’s eyes.</p>

<p>James Hamilton, who had this evening experienced the
opposites of extreme agony and extreme happiness, was
only a mere long-headed specimen of the weavers of Daldaff.
Having saved a little money, and acquired a reputation
for prudence and honesty, he had been able, when
the Glasgow work was first introduced into the village, to
get himself appointed by a manufacturing house in that city
as agent for supplying employment to his brethren; and as
he not only enjoyed a commission upon the labours of his
neighbours, but also kept a number of looms going upon
his own account, he might be considered the most prosperous
man in the village. He had been married for many
years, but was blessed with only one child, the fair young
girl who was rescued from death in the manner above
described. He was one of those individuals, who, though
entitled to praise for their correct dealings and sagacious
conduct in life, are yet apt to excite dislike by their contenting
themselves too exclusively with those properties,
and not showing enough of the amenity and friendliness
of disposition, by which alone society at large is rendered
agreeable. You could always make sure that James
Hamilton would do you no wrong, but you were also impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
with the certainty that neither would he do you
any good; and if it be possible that there can be an
excess of circumspection and prudence, he erred in that
excess. Rarely giving way to feeling himself, he could
hardly believe that it existed in others, or, if he did acknowledge
its existence, he despised it as only the symptom
of an unworldly character. Even on seeing a single and
beloved child rescued from destruction, though he could
not repress the first gush of grateful and joyful emotion, he
almost immediately after relapsed into his usual coldness,
and seemed to chide himself for having been betrayed into
that excitement.</p>

<p>Adam Cuthbertson, who had done for him almost the
greatest service that one man could do to another, was the
son of a poor widow in Sarkinholm, and now resided with
a relation at Daldaff, under whom he was acquiring the
universal craft of the district. Though graced with only
a very limited education, and condemned to almost unceasing
toil, Adam was a youth of some spirit and ingenuity.
An old <em>black buke</em> of Scotch songs lay constantly on the
beam at his left hand, and the rush of the shuttle and the
dunt of the lay went in unison with as clear a pipe as ever
lilted up the notes of our national minstrelsy. It was even
whispered that Adam had himself composed a few songs,
or there were at least certain ditties which the lasses of
Daldaff might occasionally be heard singing at their washings
on the haugh, and which were privately attributed to
his pen—though, it is to be remarked, his modesty would
never permit him to confess the soft impeachment. Adam
also contrived to obtain some scientific books, which he
pored over at night by his uncle’s fireside, or, in summer,
beneath a little bower which he had constructed in the
garden. He was thought to be less steady at his work than
some duller lads, and the case was not mended by a particular
improvement which he had carried into effect upon
the machinery of his loom. Although he practically demonstrated
that he could work more with the same trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
by means of this alteration, the old workmen only shook
their heads at it, and wished he might work as much with it
in the long-run. It happened one day, that, as he was <em>dressing</em>
his web with the brushes, he lost his balance by mere
accident, and fell head foremost through the white expanse
before him, producing, of course, irremediable ruin. “Ay,
ay,” remarked some of the old stagers, “I never thought
ony gude would come o’ thae improvements. Wha ever
heard o’ ony <em>ordinar</em> workman playing sic a plisky?” Others,
less disposed to observe the strict doctrines of causation,
would ask what else could be expected of “that newfangled
way o’ working the hiddles.” The very minister, honest
man, was heard to hazard a quiet witticism on the subject,
not from any ill-will towards his young parishioner, but just
because the joke could hardly be avoided: “I was aye jalousing,”
said the worthy divine one day to his elder, James
Hamilton, “that Yedie wad some day or other fa’ through
his wark.” It is to be mentioned with regret that Hamilton,
notwithstanding his obligations to the young man, was
one of those who regarded his frank-spirited character and
forward genius with least favour. This did not appear to
be solely the result of the opposition of their characters.
Hamilton, who, in any circumstances, would have been
sure to disapprove of the qualities manifested by Adam
Cuthbertson, appeared almost to have contracted an additional
dislike for him, on account of the very obligation
which ought to have made him his friend. He seemed to
dread the claims which the rescue of his child might establish,
and acted as if he thought it necessary to give as little
encouragement to those claims as possible.</p>

<p>There was, however, <em>one</em> individual who did full justice
both to the superior character and the gallant achievement
of Cuthbertson. This was Susan Hamilton, the fair young
girl whom he had saved. Susan at the time of her rescue
was too young to regard her deliverer with any other feeling
than that of grateful respect. But as she advanced towards
womanhood, the childish feeling of awe with which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
had always beheld him when they chanced to meet, became
gradually exchanged for a sentiment of a softer and tenderer
character, though not less bashful and abased. Adam’s
feelings towards her experienced a similar change. Ever
after the day when he saved her life, he had taken rather
more interest in that fair head and those sweet blue eyes,
than in the features of any other child of the same age
whom he saw tripping to school. But this feeling was
merely one of circumstances. It solely referred to the
adventure by which he had been so happy as to restore
her to the arms of her father. Susan, however, in a very
few years, ceased to be a little girl tripping to school. Her
figure became considerably taller, and more attractive. Her
blue eyes became filled with deeper and more thoughtful
meanings. Her cheek, when she approached her deliverer,
assumed a richer hue; and her voice, when it addressed
him, surprised him with new tones. Sometimes he would
hardly <em>permit himself to think</em> that she was in the least different
from what she had been. He would still speak to
her as a man addressing a child. But after they had parted,
he would feel his soul troubled with a delight he had never
before experienced. He would <em>feel</em>, though he did not
think, that she was different. Need any more be said than
that he in time found himself at once loving and beloved?
The sun never set with a richer glow, nor did the flowers
ever give out a richer perfume, than on the evening, when,
in the woods of Craigcross, Adam Cuthbertson and Susan
Hamilton first confessed their mutual attachment.</p>

<p>But fate was adverse to the passion of these amiable
beings. James Hamilton, with all his homely wisdom, had
so far given way to a wretched ambition as to wish his
daughter to match in a sphere above his own rank. Laird
Ganderson, of Windigate, had marked out Susan at church
as a very proper person to undertake the management of
his household, an office just become vacant in consequence
of the death of his mother. Being arrived at the full and
perfect age of forty-seven years, the beauty of the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
lady was perhaps a smaller consideration with the laird,
than the contiguity of a few fields lately purchased by her
father, to his own somewhat dilapidated property. He
therefore made some overtures to James Hamilton, which
that individual listened to in a manner far from unfavourable.
It was soon made up between them that Susan was
to become Mrs Ganderson: all that remained to be done
was to gain the approbation of the young woman herself
towards the scheme. Susan, who, in addition to many
better qualities, possessed a gift of rustic humour, endeavoured
to convey her sentiments to the laird in a delicate
way, by one evening frying him a dish of sliced peats instead
of Scotch collops; but the laird took it all as a good
joke, and said he only liked her the better for her waggery.
In fact, being anxious to have her only on the ordinary
principles of a mercantile speculation, he was not to be
turned aside by any nice delicacy, any more than he would
have been prevented from buying a horse at a fair, by the
animal showing a reluctance to part with its former proprietor.
On the other hand, Cuthbertson felt in a manner
entirely different. A taunt which he received one night
from the father, respecting the narrowness of his circumstances
and prospects, determined him to quit Daldaff in
search of fortune, taking no care but first to interchange
with Susan a vow of eternal fidelity.</p>

<p>For one full year Susan was enabled to parry the addresses
of the laird and the entreaties of her father. The
former spent a great part of every day at James Hamilton’s,
where he smoked incessantly, or, if he ceased at all, it was
only to ask for liquor, or to utter a ribald jest. By this
familiarity he only rendered himself the more intolerable
to Susan. But it had a different effect upon the father.
The laird became so thoroughly ingratiated with that individual,
that there was no exertion of friendship which
Hamilton would not make in his behalf. In fact, in order
to secure to his daughter the eclat of being lady of Windigate,
he was understood to have compromised all that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
was worth in the world in securities for the behoof of his
future son-in-law, whose fortune was suspected to be in
no very flourishing condition. The unfortunate weaver
exemplified a very common failing in the most sagacious
characters, namely, a disposition, after a whole lifetime of
prudence, to give way to some notably ridiculous error,
which is rendered unalarming to them from its being totally
different in character and tendency from any that they have
been accustomed to avoid.</p>

<p>At length came evil days. Owing to some turn of affairs
in the progress of the war, cotton-weaving experienced a severe
shock, by which many of the best Glasgow houses were
materially damaged, and thousands of operatives throughout
the country were thrown out of work. The very respectable
establishment for which Hamilton had long acted as agent,
lingered for a time in existence, and was able occasionally
to send a small scantling of work, hardly enough to employ
a tenth part of the population of the village. When the
carrier was expected to come with these small supplies,
numbers of poor men, attended by their wives and children,
all of whom were alike unemployed, would go out for miles
to meet the eagerly expected vehicle, to learn how much
work was brought, and what prospect there was of more.
On the small bag being opened by Hamilton, and perhaps
only three webs being displayed, the grief of the poor people
was beyond all description. The married men would
then, by Hamilton’s directions, draw lots for those precious
morsels of employment. While this process went forward,
what eager breathless hope in the faces of both men
and women, tempered, at the same time, by a religious
sense of the misery which each man knew that his own
success would inflict upon some equally deserving neighbour!
What despair was depicted in each honest homely
face, as it turned from the fatal lottery, upon the unhappy
family group, which, more eagerly than himself, had watched
the result of his throw! With what joy, mingled with sad
sympathies for the rest, would the successful man bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
home his load, though he knew that the price of his labour
would hardly be sufficient to supply the food necessary to
support him, even though he were to work sixteen hours
a-day! At length, towards winter, even these wretchedly
insufficient supplies were stopped. Hamilton’s employers,
after every effort to keep themselves afloat, were obliged
to give way also; and, consequently, the Daldaff agency
became at once a dead letter. People talk of the exemption
of the present generation from disasters by fire and
sword, which so frequently befell their ancestors; but what
calamity was ever inflicted upon the poor, even in the most
lawless days of past history, equal to the desolation which
is now so often occasioned in a large district, by a total
cessation of the staple employment? The cots which gave
shelter to our ancestors, were rebuilt in three days, after
even the most savage invasion; the herds, which had been
gathered off to some place of security, were restored to
their indestructible pastures. The calamity, if unaccompanied
by severe loss of life, must have been only, in
general, an exciting adventure. But what retreat, what
consolation is there for the hordes of poor artizans, who,
by some commercial accident, arising, perhaps, from the
imprudence of a few merchants, or some political or warlike
movement, are deprived of the customary weekly
pittance? It may be relied on, that such disasters exceed
in measure of sorrow almost any kind of historical distress,
except those of plague or famine. No other accident but
these last ever introduced such coldness to the poor man’s
hearth, such despair to his heart, or made him regret with
so bitter a pang that he had others to care for besides himself.</p>

<p>Amidst the public calamity, one of a most grievous
nature overtook the father of our heroine. The affairs of
the laird, which had long been desperately out of order,
and for some time were only sustained by the aid of his
intended father-in-law, came to a complete stand-still;
and, the whole wealth of James Hamilton being engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
in securities, he was at once reduced to the condition in
which he had entered life. The stroke at first seemed
likely to be fatal. Thus to lose the whole earnings of a
laborious life—to forfeit, at the eleventh hour, by one
miserable piece of imprudence, all the honours of the wisely
spent day, was more, almost, than he could bear. He
had, however, two comforters in his affliction—the worthy
old minister, who in these calamitous times had been a
succouring angel to his flock—and his daughter, an angel
of a still more gracious kind, who, forgetting all the severities
with which she had been treated, and thinking only of his
present affliction, applied herself to the sacred task of soothing
his wounded mind, and inspiring him with hopes of
better times. The change of his circumstances produced
a complete change in the mind of Hamilton. Having no
longer wealth to care for, the jealous sentinels with which
he had guarded it were withdrawn. The crust of worldly
selfishness was broken off his character, and all its better
affections were again called into free play. His eyes were
now opened to the wickedness of which he had been guilty,
in endeavouring to force the affections of his daughter,
and he only wished that he were again as he had been a
twelvemonth before, in order to make her happy with the
man of her heart.</p>

<p>Weeks of partial famine passed on, and now the distresses
of the villagers were suddenly doubled by the premature
commencement of a very severe winter. With
the exception of their small patches of potatoes and garden
vegetables, there seemed hardly any resource for them
during the whole winter. The minister, whose own income
was exhausted in providing for their wants, thought it necessary,
under these distressing circumstances, to call them
all together, and join them in one solemn exercise of humiliation
appropriate to the occasion. Just as this was
concluded, a boy belonging to an inn about ten miles distant
upon the Glasgow road, arrived, after a toilsome journey
through the snow, and gave the joyful news that a cart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
filled with webs was storm-stayed at his master’s house, on
its way to the village, the trade having suddenly experienced
a slight revival. Transported with this intelligence,
though no one could guess by whom the work could have
been sent, they one and all resolved to proceed to Redcraigs,
where the cart was lying, and aid in clearing a way
for it through the snow. Every spade and semblance of
a spade was then put in requisition, and the half of the
bannocks in the village were brought forward, without the
least regard to individual property, to provision the troop
of pioneers. Thirty men set out early next morning on
this expedition, graced with the blessings and prayers of
all who saw them depart.</p>

<p>The snow, it was found, had only fallen to the depth of
three feet, but it was drifted in many hollow parts of the
road to six times that depth, so as to present an insurmountable
obstacle to the progress of a cart. At all those
places the weavers exerted themselves as they advanced
to clear away the gelid heaps. The toil was most severe;
but what these poor starved men wanted in strength, they
made up by zeal—that zeal, above all others, which is inspired
by the wish of answering the clamour of a hungry
family circle with the necessary bite. The thought that
work was before them, that money would again be procured,
and, for that money, food to supply “the bairns at hame,”
nerved every arm with superhuman energy; and as the
country people every where lent a willing, though less enthusiastic
assistance, the party had before mid-day cleared
their way to Redcraigs. What was their surprise on being
met there by their friend Adam Cuthbertson, of whom
they had not heard ever since he left Daldaff, and who
now informed them, with ineffable pleasure beaming in his
eyes, that he had been the happy means of procuring them
this supply of work. He had entered, he said, into the
service of a manufacturer at Glasgow, and having divulged
to him a plan of improving the loom, had been advanced
to a very onerous place of trust in the factory. His employer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
having weathered on till the present revival of trade,
he had used the little influence he had, to get his old master,
of whose misfortunes he had heard, appointed to an agency,
and was favoured with one of the very first parcels of work
that was to be had, which he was now conveying to the
relief of his old friends at Daldaff. “Let us on now, my
friends,” cried Adam; “and, before night is far spent, we
shall be able to tell the women and the bairns that the bad
times are now blown by, and that every one will get his porridge
and his broth as he used to do.” The cavalcade then
set forward, the cart drawn by three horses in line, and
every man more ready than another, either to clear away
the drifted heap that lay before it, or to urge it with his
desperate shoulder over every such impediment that might
happen to be left. Though the way was long, and the
labour severe, and the strength of the poor weavers not
very great, yet every eye and voice maintained its cheerfulness,
and the song, the jest, and the merry tale, were
kept up to the very last. The wintry sun had set upon
the snowy hills ere the procession came within sight of
Daldaff; yet all the women and children were collected at
the Loanbraehead, near the village, to see it approach;
and when the cart was first discerned turning a neighbouring
height, with its large attendant train, a shout of natural
joy arose through the clear air, such as might burst from
those who gaze from the shore upon a wreck, and see
the crew, one by one, make their escape from destruction.
James Hamilton was there, though much reduced by a
recent illness; and the joy which seized him on being informed
by the workmen of his appointment, was almost
too much for his frame. He looked in vain, however,
for Cuthbertson, to pour before him the thanks of a repentant
spirit. That excellent young man had eluded
the observation of all, and, diving through some of the lanes
of the village, had taken refuge in the house of his uncle.
He found that much as he had longed to see gladness
once more restored to these poor villagers, he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
endure the scene at last. He had therefore escaped from
their gratitude; and it was not till Hamilton sought him
in his old lodgings, that he was at length discovered. The
old man took him warmly by the hand, which he did not
quit, till, leading him to his own house, he deposited it in
that of his fair daughter. “Susan Hamilton,” said he,
“twice have you been saved by this good youth; you are
now fairly his own property—you are no longer mine.
May you both be happy!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="FLITTING_DAY">FLITTING DAY.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Our readers will perhaps recollect a former article, in
which we treated of the subject of removals—that is to
say, the practice so general in Scotland (though otherwise
in England) of shifting almost every year from one house
to another, in a constant expectation of finding the <span class="allsmcap">TO
KALON</span>, as the Greeks call it, or, as we shall rather style
it, the <span class="allsmcap">QUITE THE THING</span> of house accommodation, which,
however, is discovered at one year’s end to be exactly as
remote as it was a twelvemonth before, and still, like general
happiness, is “on before”—far looming over the
horizon, like a vessel bound for some distant part of the
globe, and not to be caught or overtaken, let us speed after
it as we may. We have heard various individuals acknowledge
that there were some good <em>home truths</em> in that article,
though we rather believe the housewives in general were
surprised at our blindness to the beauties of a good back-green.
Let that be as it may, there was one thing in which
that article was totally deficient—to wit, an account of
the particular horrors of <em>removing day</em> itself, or, as we in
Scotland call it, <em>flitting day</em>—a day styled in the calendar
Whitsunday, and dedicated to we don’t know what sacred
use, but which, without regard to its sacred use, whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
that may be, we think men might wish that, above all
others, it were fairly blotted out of the calendar—expunged
from the very year itself—utterly annihilated and forgotten,
because of the unhappy secular use to which it has been
put from time immemorial. The 25th of May, or Whitsunday
old style, is indeed a day of peculiar agony amongst
us. It is a day consecrated to the disruption of all local
ties, to the rending of every kind of pleasant association,
to the discomfiture of all the household goods. The very
week in which it occurs, is black with its atmosphere of
pain.</p>

<p>It may be surprising to persons unacquainted with Scotland,
that the people should be so fond of removing, since
the day on which that event takes place is apt to be so
very disagreeable. They might as well wonder that people
should ever marry, when they know so very well that
the charge of a family is apt to be burdensome. Candlemas
day, on which people take their houses, is a day of heedless
joy, a day of fond and delirious anticipation; and
Whitsunday is to it what execution-day is to the particular
time when an unfortunate man was tempted to enrich
himself at some other body’s expense. “On Wednesday
I killed my wife, on Saturday I was hanged,” as the child’s
rhyme goes: no one can doubt that Wednesday was in
this case a very pleasant day, whatever might be the state
of the honest man’s feelings at the end of the week. So it
is with Candlemas and Whitsunday. On the former of
these days we are actuated by a spirit of spite and dissatisfaction
with our present abode; it is every thing that is
disagreeable, and we must at all hazards get quit of it.
Accordingly, the taking of another, and, as we think, better
habitation, naturally appears as the opening of a haven
of relief, and, of course, we have a great deal of either
positive or negative pleasure in the day. Nor is this satisfaction
confined to the day on which the new house is
leased: it extends up to the very commencement of that
week of suffering which involves Whitsunday—up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
first material disarrangement of furniture preparatory to
removal. During the time which elapses between the leasing
of the new habitation and our removal to it, we abandon
all care for our present abode. Any thing that goes wrong
about it must just remain so. If a lock were required for
the door, we would scarcely put ourselves to the trouble of
getting it, but remain content with some provisional system
of security, such as putting a table behind it. A large piece
of plaster might fall down from the ceiling, or half of the
floor of the dining-room sink into the kitchen—a whole
gable or side-wall, almost, might fall away, but we would
never think of troubling ourselves with any attempt at repairs.
It is a horrid house at any rate, and, for all the
time we are to be in it, it does not matter. We’ll soon be
getting into our nice new house, and I’ll warrant you no
plaster will fall down from the ceiling <em>there</em>, nor either floor
or gable give way. Every thing will be right when we
get to —— Street. The house, under this system of
feeling, begins to wear a desolate look. Every thing is
permitted, according to the old Scottish phrase, just to
hang as it grows. The whole bonds of household discipline
are relaxed. The servants, who are to be changed
too perhaps, as well as the house, begin to do things <em>any
way</em>, and yet the mistress hardly chides them. The fact
is, she has given up all idea of comfort in the condemned
house, and lives entirely on the hope of seeing every thing
trig in her new abode. She would make no great complaint,
as we verily believe, if the servants obliged her by
their carelessness to spend all the remaining part of the
lease up to her knees in water. Every thing will be right
when we get to —— Street, so we’ll just put up with it.
Every now and then one of the children comes in, like the
messengers in Macbeth, to tell her of the progress of mischief.
One has to mention, that a boy throwing stones
has just broken two panes in the drawing-room window,
the lower chess having been up at the time. No matter; all
will be right when we get to —— Street. Another “cream-faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
loon” rushes in to say, that the girls in the kitchen
have just broken down the grate, and snapped the poker
in two. No matter; all will be right when we get to ——
Street. Nay, it is not too much to suppose that, although
she were told of the house having just begun to sink into
the earth, she would take it all with the most philosophic
coolness, and console herself for every present mishap by a
reference to the joys which are to be experienced in that
home of promise. The prospect of a removal, it will be observed,
is thus enough even to revolutionise human nature.
People abandon their most cherished objects of care, and
disregard that of which they are in general most solicitous,
under the influence of this prospect. Like the pilgrim of
Bunyan (not to speak it profanely), they thrust their fingers
in their ears, in order to shut out all lateral subjects
of thought, and rush on—on—on towards the new house.</p>

<p>At last the throes of actual removal begin to be felt,
and, for the time, all happy anticipation is deadened within
us. You have long ago ascertained, by a ceremonious call
upon the present tenants of your new mansion, that they
cannot remove an hour before Whitsunday at noon, which
gives you the comfortable assurance that your flitting will
be, like a sharp fever, soon over. The lady who is coming
to <em>your</em> house soon after makes a ceremonious call upon <em>you</em>,
and ascertains, of course, that you can only remove at that
hour also. If matters should happen otherwise—if you
are either going to a house altogether new, or to one which
can be vacated a short while before the term-day, then
what a convenience it is!—we shall have the painters in,
and get it all put to rights before we flit a single stick;
and after it is all right, we shall remove quite at our leisure.
By this plan we shall not only avoid the risk of breaking
things, which is always the case in a hurried flitting, but
we shall get porters and carters a great deal cheaper, for
these fellows, you know, charge three wages on the actual
term-day, when every body is flitting. But if it should
happen, as above mentioned, that you are limited to a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
hours, so that your furniture, as it goes out, will meet the
furniture of another person coming in, and, as it goes in,
will meet, in tug of war, that of another person coming
out, then the blessed anticipation of your future comforts
in “that nice house” reconciles you to every thing, and
you make yourself think that, after all, it is better, when
one <em>is</em> flitting, to have it all over in the shortest possible
space of time.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even when you have a vantage space, you
are strangely jockeyed out of it before you are aware. Say
the house is to be painted before you go into it. Being
quite at your ease, you are satisfied that the painters are
engaged about two months before the term. You know
very well that these men are the greatest of all rascals; that,
indeed, they have no other principle within them but just
to put people to as much trouble as possible. But two
months! that must surely be sufficient. Well, the painters
come all this time before the term, and, like the ancient
Spanish navigators, take possession of a newly-discovered
country, mark the job for their own, by planting a nasty
pail in one room, and setting up a brush on end against the
wall in another. You look in about a week after, and see
the pail and the brush <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu quo</i>: the fellows have as yet
done nothing but taken <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">seisin</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> You think this is not just
quite right, and calling in a cool easy way at the master’s
as you go home, express your wish that the job should be
immediately proceeded with, being anxious to get into the
house as long before the term as possible. The painter is all
politeness, and promises to <em>put men upon the house</em> next
morning, so that it will be got ready for your reception in
<em>no time</em>—by which he appears to mean a space of time so
brief as not to be worth defining, but which you eventually
find to have signified that the job would be finished <em>not at
all in time</em>. As you come home to your dinner next afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
you take a turn that way to see how “the men” are
getting on. The house is as empty and desolate as ever;
but, from a change in the relative situations of the pail and
the brush, you see that they <em>have</em> been there. On inspecting
things more minutely, you find that one bed-room has
been washed down, and is now, to use a kitchen phrase,
<em>swimming</em>. Well, this is a beginning, you think. “The
men” have been doing what they could to-day, and to-morrow
they would be a good way advanced. On this
supposition, you take no more thought about the house for
three or four days more, when, dropping in as before, you
have the satisfaction of seeing that there is <em>another pail</em>, and
that the ceiling of the dining-room has been whitewashed.
Still, dilatory as the rascals evidently are, you hardly think
there is a sufficient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus fœderis</i>, or breach of treaty, to
entitle you to go and blow up the polite man at head-quarters.
You suffer for another day; and then, dropping
in again, you find a little Flibbertigibbet of a boy exerting
himself with his tiny arms to whitewash the ceiling of the
parlour. Well, my boy, where are “the men?” This is
your question; but for answer you only learn that there
have never been any men in the matter—nobody has ever
been here but Flibbertigibbet himself. You feel, at this
intelligence, almost as much bewildered and obfusculated
as George the Second was when he asked an Irish sergeant
at a review after the seven years’ war, where was the
—— regiment? and was answered, “Please your majesty,
I’se the —— regiment;” the Hibernian being in reality the
only man that had survived the last campaign. Is this
<em>the men</em>, you say to yourself, that Mr —— promised to put
upon the house? You go of course instantly, and, Mr
—— being, by his own good fortune, from home, you leave
a note for him, expressed in such terms as you are sure
must bring him to his senses, if any thing will. Dropping
in next day to see the effect, your ire is soothed at finding
three men at work besides Flibbertigibbet, and every thing
seems going on so well, that you trouble them no more for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
a week. But it is needless to pursue this painful theme
any farther. Suffice it to say, that, having once got these
artists into the house, you feel by and by as if they were
never again to be got out; you fear that, contrary to the
catastrophe of the well-known jest, there will be no letting
go the painter. Their pails, and buckets, and brushes,
and all their slopery, are just as rife in the house a week
before the term as they were a month earlier; and still to
every remonstrance Mr —— replies, that all he can do is
to <em>put on more men next Monday morning</em>. It is all you
can do, perhaps, to get the odious varlets trundled out,
“pots and all,” on the very day before you are compelled
to remove; so that, instead of having ample scope and
verge enough, as you expected, you find that you will be
just as much hurried and flurried as if you had been going
to a house not previously vacated.</p>

<p>Well, whatever be the foregoing circumstances, flitting
day at last arrives in all its horrors. The lady of the household
has for several days been storing all kinds of small
things by into drawers and boxes, that they might the more
safely be transported, so that the family finds itself already
deprived of the half of those things which are necessary to
comfort, and the whole of what minister to luxury. Your
shaving-box is amissing two mornings before flitting day,
and has to be fished up, like a “drowned honour,” from
the bottom of some abyss of well-regarded trifles. When
you come home to dinner on flitting day eve, it is any
money for a boot-jack. You take your meals that evening
without table-cloths; and unless you can bring down your
proud stomach to a brown kitchen bowl, any thing like a
comforting drink is out of the question. The crepuscular
anguish of the day is already felt. You go to your bed
that night off an uncarpeted floor, and in the midst of all
kinds of tubs covered up with packsheet, and looking-glasses
swaddled up in linen. If you get a nightcap, you
may consider yourself lucky above all mortal men. You
go to bed, but sleep there is none, for you have to rise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
next morning long before the usual hour, and the anticipatory
sense of what you have to go through that day
fills every nook and cranny of your mind. You awake to
a rush of children and servants on the stairs; and though
you exert every nerve of your memory to recollect the new
geography of things in the room, it is ten to one but you
stumble over some tub or chest in the dark, where you
thought no tub should be; and, upon the whole, the feeling
with which you thrust your poor cold distressed shanks
into your vestments, is not much short of that which must
possess a man about to walk to the scaffold. A breakfast
composed of every thing but the proper materials, and taken
out of every thing but the proper vessels, collects such a
group of shabby slatternly figures as you did not before
think yourself husband, or father, or master to. The meal
is gulped in agonies of haste, for the carts were to be at
the door at seven exactly, and it is now within a few minutes
of the hour. Well, the carts come; one by one are
your household goods displaced and packed up on those
vehicles. Grates are placed on the breadth of their backs
at the bottom, by way of ballast. Then mattresses go over
them, to make an agreeable flooring for other things.
Tables are tumbled a-top, with their legs reared high in
the air, like cart-horses enjoying themselves in their Sunday
pastures; and to the ropes with which the heaps are bound
down, are attached fry-pans, children’s toys, and other
light articles, all by way of garnishing. Though far above
such things in general, you are obliged on this occasion to
see after very mean details, lest your property should suffer
some dreadful damage. The more delicate articles are
necessarily entrusted to porters or other serviceable individuals,
who carry them separately to your new house. “The
boys,” glad to escape the school for a day, are employed,
to their great satisfaction, in transporting single things,
“which don’t break;” and the servants see after certain
baskets of crystal and crockery, “which do.” To see all
things properly disposed of—each to the individual best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
fitted for it—is your business, and no easy one it is. At
length, after every thing is fairly packed off, the lady and
yourself walk away together, the cat following in a pillow-slip
under the charge of your second eldest daughter.</p>

<p>Before three in the afternoon, the whole of your furniture,
broken and whole, has been thrust, higglety-pigglety,
into your new house, where you find all things in the
most chaotic state of confusion. Kitchen things repose
in the dining-room; drawing-room chairs are deposited in
the kitchen; and a huge chest of drawers stands in the
vestibule, with a shoulder thrust so far out into the <em>fair
way</em> as to render it almost impossible to pass. The kitchen
grate is only to be built in after six o’clock in the evening,
when the masons are released from their day’s work; so
there is no possibility of cooking any thing. A <em>provisional</em>
arrangement is therefore made on this point. You, and
your wife, and your children, and all your assistants, bivouac
in some shabby parlour, and regale yourselves
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">absit elegantia</i>) with rolls and porter. Henry, your eldest
son, who has wrought like a Turk all day, leads the feast
with his coat off, and the scene can only be compared to
a rough-and-tumbling in the back woods of America. No
ceremony as to knives. Rolls, and even large loaves, are
torn through the middle, and large mouthfuls dug out from
the mass by the thumb or forefinger. The liquor goes
round in some ordinary vessel, never before appropriated
to such a purpose, and all feeling of discomfort being stolen
away by the novelty and strong natural feeling of the occasion,
the jest and laugh abound. Even in the midst of
all the disarray, great hopes and expectations are expressed
regarding the new mansion. Such capital high ceilings!
Such a broad elegant lobby! So different from that dismal
hole we have left! Or, if the ceilings are low, and the lobby
narrow, while in the former house they were the reverse, the
contrast is drawn in reference to some other points where
superiority is indisputable, while the demerits of the new
abode are cast discreetly into shade, only to be brought out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
and complained of at the approach of next Candlemas. You
either have left a good view from the windows, or you
are entering upon one. Suppose your former house, being
in the centre of the town, had hardly any view, then your
wife thus comments upon it:—“Such a dark confined
place! Nothing to be seen from the windows, but the
opposite houses, or else the chimney-stalks and <em>old wives</em>.
Now, here we are quite in the country. The drawing-room
commands Fife and North Berwick Law, and even from
the bed-rooms we catch a great lump of the Dalmahoy
hills. If we just step to the end of the house, we are into
the fields; and then we’ll be so very quiet here, compared
with what we were. Not a carriage or a cart passing from
morning till night. We’ll get some rest at last; and truth
to tell, my health is in great need of it. How truly delightful
thus to get fairly out of that black, smoky, noisy
town, to a place where we can enjoy all the pleasures of
the country, and yet be within reach of every convenience
of the city! And just consider how much benefit the walk
must be to your own health. We formerly lived so near
your place of business, that you got no exercise at all, seeing
that I never could prevail upon you to take a walk on
purpose. But here you <em>must</em> walk, and the good it must
do you will be visible in a week’s time,”—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. If
the case has been totally the reverse, you are addressed as
follows:—“How delightful to get fairly away from that
cold, out-of-the-world, dull place, and once more feel ourselves
snug in the town! We’ve no prospects here from
the windows; but, ’deed, when folk have prospects, I
never see that they make much use of them. For my part, I
never looked out of the drawing-room windows once in the
month; for what are the Fife hills or North Berwick Law
after one has once seen them? [What philosophy we
have here!] And then, what good did we get from the
garden? It was just a fash to keep right; and I’m sure,
when we had paid the gardener, we did not make a penny off
the vegetables. Now, here, although there be little prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
from any of the windows, we’re at least a great deal
better protected from the wind. If we have not a garden
of our own, have we not the green market almost at the
door? And such a weary distance you had to walk every
day! No more of that now. Here, when you want a
walk, you can take one; and when you don’t like, you can
let it alone. Walks are very well, perhaps, in good summer
weather; but I’ve no idea of seeing you plash through
a long dirty road twice every day through the whole winter.
Whenever we want either a walk or a prospect, we’ll
get it in the Queen Street gardens; for you know Mrs
—— has told me that we may have her key whenever we
like. In our old ill-contrived house, we had no place to
put any thing off our hand; not so much as a cupboard in
the whole house; but now, you see, we have as many
presses as rooms, and a capital cellar for coals and lumber.
And how near we are here to all the best shops! If it
were for nothing but the convenience of getting tea-bread
at a minute’s warning from Mr Littlejohn, the baker,
whenever any person calls upon us in the evening, it would
have been worth while to remove to this house. The lass
likewise tells me that there is a very obliging woman, quite
at hand, who keeps a mangle for the use of the neighbourhood,
which will be a great convenience to the family; and
that she will take in hand to supply us with milk or cream
at any hour of the day,”—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Thus, it will be
observed, neither the spirit of discontent nor the spirit of
hope is ever without material for feeding its particular
necessities.</p>

<p>You have now got fairly into your new house, bag and
baggage. It is after the manner, however, of a certain
pound of comfits which a carrier once brought from a city
confectioner to a country customer. The paper bag having
proved insufficient in the journey, the contents had dispersed
themselves throughout all the other packages in the
cart. Every parcel, and bag, and box, had to be shaken
clear of the lurking carvy, till, the whole of the bulky articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
having been discharged and laid off, the little white
particles were found at the bottom mingled with straws,
fragments of rope, and paper, and all other kinds of trash.
The whole having been swept out, however, the honest
old carrier brought them to the owner in a large platter,
saying, with the air of a man who has relieved his conscience
of some uncommon weight, “Here they are, mistress;
ye hae them a’ for me.” Just like the comfits are
all your goods and chattels—your ox, and your ass, and
your children, and your every thing else—the whole are
there; but in such a state! Perhaps, to add to your distresses,
you have to delay putting the principal rooms to
rights till the painters have to be with you. This, of course,
adjourns the termination of your agonies <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</i>. Perhaps,
about three months after, when you have battled the rascals
out of one room into another, much after the manner of the
siege of St Sebastian, you get at last into the enviable
attitude “as you were,” resolving of course never again
to remove as long as you live, but still as ready before next
2d of February to take that step as ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FALLACIES_OF_THE_YOUNG3">FALLACIES OF THE YOUNG.<br>
<span class="fs80">“DEBTORS AND CREDITORS.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The common feeling respecting debtors and creditors is
very erroneous, and, as is common with popular fallacies,
it imposes with double force upon the young and inexperienced.
Debtors are represented in all works of fiction,
and in the ordinary language of a large portion of society,
as a set of amiable, unfortunate, and most interesting persons:
Creditors, on the other hand, as an unmingled
generation of execrable wretches, with a hardness of heart
that would not disgrace an executioner, and indeed only
one remove from another stony class of men, the much
misrepresented jailers. Now, the person who writes this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
article has known many debtors and creditors, and he can
say that, in by far the most of cases, the latter were the better
class of men. He alludes, of course, not to commercial
men at large, who are in their own persons, in general, as
much of the one thing as the other, but to cases where the
creditor is a tradesman, and the debtor a customer; that
is, where the debt is not incurred in the intercourse of business,
but for the personal use and benefit of the debtor.
In these cases, so far from the creditor being an unfeeling
and relentless tyrant, as he is generally represented, he is
only the indignant victim of the imprudence or guilt of the
debtor. The latter may be an amiable and interesting
person, for we often find these characteristics united to
consummate folly and disregard of the rights of others.
But the young must beware how they set down debtors, in
a class, as purely estimable and entitled to sympathy, while
they at the same time look upon creditors as only ruthless
persecutors, worthy of the bitterest execration. They may
depend upon it, that no notion could be more erroneous,
no error more apt to be fatal to them in their course through
life. They must be informed that to incur debt for their
own gratifications, without the ability to discharge it, is
just another thing for selling themselves as slaves to their
creditors. After doing so, they are no longer entirely free:
part of themselves becomes the property of another, and
thus they lose the respect of the world, which cannot see
one man indulge in enjoyments at the expense of his fellow,
without thinking of him very meanly. The incurring of
debt for personal gratification is odious, for many reasons.
In the first place, it violates that rule of nature which appoints
every man to work for himself, and only enjoy as he
works. It also tends to occasion the ruin of innocent persons.
Creditors are not invariably rich, as one would
suppose them to be, from reading novels. They are more
frequently poor, industrious persons, who, in losing money
by their debtors, are apt to be made debtors themselves,
and thereby ruined. In fact, the case stands generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
thus: An idle or extravagant person procures support for
his bad appetites, and is enabled to show himself off as a
very fine fellow, at the expense of a humble-minded honest
trader, who confines himself constantly to his business, and
forbids himself almost every indulgence, in order that he
may be able to pay every one to whom <em>he</em> is indebted, and
discharge all the other duties of a good citizen. Now, if
young people will bring their naturally generous feelings to
bear upon this point, they will see that the debtor, and not
the creditor, is alone worthy of execration. And they may
be assured, that, where creditors show a severity to their
debtors, it is generally either merited by the latter, or is
dictated by a justifiable consideration of the danger into
which they are thrown by the non-payment of the money
which is their due, and which they may be owing in their
turn to some other person.</p>

<p>In every rule there are exceptions; but it is necessary
to guard against the breaking down of <em>great rules</em> by allowing
for <em>trifling exceptions</em>. Because good men sometimes
incur debt, and become insolvent, through no fault of
theirs, we must not infringe upon the majesty of the great
maxim, that debt ought to be paid, and that its non-payment
is an evil. Young people, if they wish to prosper in
the world, will do well not to excuse all contraction of debt
for the sake of the few who contract it innocently. They
must have it impressed forcibly upon their minds, that
every pleasure in which they indulge themselves, without
the reasonable prospect of paying for it, though it be but
to the amount of one penny, is a step in error, and apt to
be the beginning of their destruction. They must have it
impressed upon their minds, that no man of good feelings
can enjoy the least comfort, if he be not conscious of working
for, or being honestly come into the possession of, fully
as much as he spends. To persist in living beyond our
incomes, is to live a life of dishonesty; and to subsist on the
industry of relatives, as is sometimes the case with the idle
and the dissolute, is worse still, for it involves an excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
meanness of spirit, ingratitude, and hard-heartedness—thus
adding depth to the crime, and will be sure to be visited
some day with feelings of anguish and remorse.</p>

<p>A predominating error among the junior classes of society,
is a disinclination to wait for a short time till they
be enabled to compete in the enjoyment of luxuries with
others they see around them, and who, it is more than
probable, have toiled long and painfully before they arrived
at their present apparently prosperous condition. This
impatience of reaching a certain height in the ladder of fortune,
without taking deliberation to mount a number of
preliminary and difficult steps, cannot, indeed, be sufficiently
reprehended, where it occurs, as it leads to that
fatal resource of incurring debts never to be paid, and that
supposed harshness of creditors, which a disordered process
of reasoning brings into view. I would here tenderly
admonish the youthful part of the community to refrain
from indulgences they cannot honestly command. Let
them believe one who has had some experience, when he
tells them that there is not the least chance of the world
running away from them; that the present generation of
grown men will not consume <em>all</em> earthly enjoyments, but
will leave a boundless variety of everything which can
please the senses, or gratify an honourable ambition.
They need, therefore, be in no hurry whatever, and take
time to build their fortune on a firm and secure basis. The
rising generation cannot lay these things sufficiently to
heart. They cannot be sufficiently taught, that suffering
under the consequences of imprudently-incurred debts does
not necessarily make them heroes—is not entitled to unmingled
sympathy, no more than a robber at the gallows is
a martyr; but that, while pity is perhaps due to them, as
to all who err in this frail world, the larger share of sympathy
ought to be bestowed on their unfortunate victims,
the creditors, whose families may be suffering from their
criminal follies, and who are apt to be by far the better and
honester men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GENERAL_INVITATIONS">GENERAL INVITATIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">“Pray, do call in an easy way some evening, you and
Mrs Balderstone; we are sure to be at home, and shall be
most happy to see you.” Such is the kind of invitation
one is apt to get from considerably intimate acquaintances,
who, equally resolved against the formality and the expense
of a particular entertainment on your account, hope to
avoid both evils by making your visit a matter of accident.
If you be a man of some experience, you will know that
all such attempts to make bread and cheese do that which
is more properly the business of a pair of fowls, end in
disappointment; and you will, therefore, take care to wait
till the general invitation becomes a particular one. But
there are inexperienced people in this world who think
every thing is as it seems, and are apt to be greatly deceived
regarding this accidental mode of visiting. For the sake
of these last, I shall relate the following adventure:—</p>

<p>I had been remarkably busy one summer, and, consequently,
obliged to refuse all kinds of invitations, general
and particular. The kind wishes of my friends had accumulated
upon me somewhat after the manner of the tunes
frozen up in Baron Munchausen’s French horn; and it
seemed as if a whole month would have been necessary to
thaw out and discharge the whole of these obligations. A
beginning, however, is always something; and, accordingly,
one rather splashy evening in November, I can’t tell how
it was, but a desire came simultaneously over myself and
Mrs Balderstone—it seemed to be by sympathy—of stepping
out to see Mr and Mrs Currie, a married pair, who
had been considerably more pressing in their general invitations
than any other of our friends. We both knew that
there was a cold duck in the house, besides a bit of cheese
just sent home by Nicholson, and understood to be more
than excellent. But, as the old Scots song says, the <em>tid</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
had come over us, and forth we must go. No sooner said
than done. Five minutes more saw us leaving our comfortable
home, my wife carrying a cap pinned under her
cloak, while to my pocket was consigned her umbrageous
comb. As we paced along, we speculated only on the
pleasure which we should give to our kind friends by thus
at last paying them a visit, when perhaps all hope of our
ever doing so was dead within them. Nor was it possible
altogether to omit reflecting, like the dog invited by his
friend to sup, upon the entertainment which lay before us;
for certainly on such an occasion the fatted calf could
hardly expect to be spared.</p>

<p>Full of the satisfaction which we were to give and receive,
we were fully into the house before we thought it
necessary to inquire if any body was at home. The servant
girl, surprised by the forward confidence of our entrée,
evidently forgot her duty, and acknowledged, when she
should have denied, the presence of her master and mistress
in the house. We were shown into a dining-room as clean,
cold, and stately as an alabaster cave, and which had the
appearance of being but rarely lighted by the blaze of hospitality.
My first impulse was to relieve my pocket, before
sitting down, of the comb, which I thought was now about
being put to its proper use; but the chill of the room stayed
my hand. I observed, at the same time, that my wife, like
the man under the influence of Eolus in the fable, manifested
no symptom of parting with her cloak. Ere we
could communicate our mutual sensations of incipient disappointment,
Mrs Currie entered with a flurried, surprised
air, and made a prodigious effort to give us welcome. But,
alas! poor Mr Currie; he had been seized in the afternoon
with a strange vertigo and sickness, and was now endeavouring,
by the advice of Dr Boak, to get some repose.
“It will be <em>such</em> a disappointment to him when he learns
that you were here, for he would have been so happy to
see you. We must just entertain the hope, however, to
see you some other night.” Although the primary idea in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
our minds at this moment was unquestionably the <em>desperatio
cibi</em>—the utter hopelessness of supper in this quarter—we
betrayed, of course, no feeling but sympathy in the illness
of our unfortunate friend, and a regret for having called at
so inauspicious a moment. Had any unconcerned person
witnessed our protestations, he could have formed no suspicion
that we ever contemplated supper, or were now in
the least disappointed. We felt anxious about nothing but
to relieve Mrs Currie, as soon as possible, of the inconvenience
of our visit, more especially as the chill of the room
was now piercing us to the bone. We therefore retired,
under a shower of mutual compliments and condolences,
and “hopes,” and “sorries,” and “have the pleasures;”
the door at last slamming after us with a noise which seemed
to say, “How very glad I am to get quit of you!”</p>

<p>When we got to the street, we certainly did not feel
quite so mortified as the dog already alluded to, seeing that
we had not, like him, been tossed over the window. But,
still the reverse of prospect was so very bitter, that for
some time we could hardly believe that the adventure was
real. By this time we had expected to be seated snug at
supper, side by side with two friends, who, we anticipated,
would almost expire with pleasure at seeing us. But here,
on the contrary, we were turned out upon the cold inhospitable
street, without a friend’s face to cheer us. We
still recollected that the cold duck remained as a fortress to
fall back upon; but, being now fairly agog in the adventure,
the idea of returning home, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">re infecta</i>, was not to be thought
of. Supper we must have in some other house than our
own, let it cost what it may. “Well,” said Mrs Balderstone,
“there are the Jacksons! They live not far from
this—suppose we drop in upon them. I’m sure we have
had enough of invitations to their house. The very last
time I met Mrs Jackson on the street, she told me she was
never going to ask us again—we had refused so long—she
was going, she said, just to let us come <em>if</em> we liked, and <em>when</em>
we liked.” Off we went, therefore, to try the Jacksons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>On applying at the door of this house, it flew open, as
it were, by enchantment, and the servant girl, so far from
hesitating like the other, seemed to expect no question to
be asked on entrée. We moved into the lobby, and inquired
if Mr and Mrs Jackson were at home, which was
answered by the girl with a surprised affirmative. We
now perceived, from the pile of hats and cloaks in the
lobby, as well as a humming noise from one of the rooms,
that the Jacksons had a large company, and that we were
understood by the servant to be part of it. The Jacksons,
thought we (I know my wife thought so, although I never
asked), give <em>some</em> people particular invitations. Her object
was now to make an honourable retreat, for, although my
dress was not entirely a walking one, and my wife’s cap
was brought with the prospect of making an appearance of
dress, we were by no means fit to match with those who
had dressed on purpose for the party, even although we
were asked to join them. Just at this moment, Mrs Jackson
happened to cross the lobby, on hospitable thoughts
intent, and saw us, than whom, perhaps, she would rather
have seen a basilisk. “Oh, Mrs Balderstone, how do
you do? How are you, Mr Balderstone? I’m so delighted
that you have come in this easy way at last. A
few of the neighbours have just dropped in upon us, and
it will be so delightful if you will join them. Come into
this room and take off your bonnet; and you, Mr Balderstone,
just you be so good as step up to the drawing-room.
You’ll find numbers there that you know. And Mr Jackson
will be so happy to see you,”—&amp;c. All this, however,
would not do. Mrs Balderstone and I not only felt a little
hurt at the want of speciality in our invitations to this
house, but could not endure the idea of mingling in a crowd
better dressed and more regularly invited than ourselves.
We therefore begged Mrs Jackson to excuse us for this
night. We had just called in an easy way in passing, and,
indeed, we never attended ceremonious parties at any time.
We would see her some other evening, when she was less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
engaged—that is to say, “we would rather see you and Mr
Jackson at Jericho than darken your doors again.” And
so off we came, with the blandest and most complimentary
language upon our tongues, and the most piqued and scornful
feelings in our hearts.</p>

<p>Again upon the street—yea, once again. What was to
be done now? Why, said Mrs Balderstone, there is excellent
old Mrs Smiles, who lives in the next street. I
have not seen her or the Misses Smiles for six months;
but the last time they were so pressing for us to return
their visit (you remember they supped with us in spring),
that I think we cannot do better than take this opportunity
of clearing scores.</p>

<p>Mrs Smiles, a respectable widow, lived with her five
daughters in a third floor in —— Street. Thither we
marched, with a hope, undiminished by the two preceding
disappointments, that here at length we would find supper.
Our knock at Mrs Smiles’s hospitable portal produced a
strange rushing noise within; and when the servant appeared,
I observed in the far, dim vista of the passage, one
or two slip-slop figures darting across out of one door into
another, and others again crossing in the opposite direction;
and then there was heard a low anxious whispering, while
a single dishevelled head peeped out from one of the doors,
and then the head was withdrawn, and all was still. We
were introduced into a room which had evidently been the
scene of some recent turmoil of no ordinary kind, for female
clothes lay scattered in every direction, besides some articles
which more properly belong to a dressing-room. We
had not been here above a minute, when we heard our
advent announced by the servant in an adjoining apartment
to Mrs Smiles herself, and some of her young ladies. A
flood of obloquy was instantly opened upon the girl by one
of her young mistresses—Miss Eliza, we thought—for having
given admission to any body at this late hour, especially
when she knew that they were to be up early next morning
to commence their journey, and had still a great many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
their things to pack. “And such a room you have shown
them into, you goose!” said the enraged Miss. The girl
was questioned as to our appearance, for she had neglected
to ask our name; and then we heard one young lady say,
“It must be these Balderstones. What can have set them
a-gadding to-night? I suppose we <em>must</em> ask them to stay
to supper, for they’ll have come for nothing else—confound
them! Mary, you are in best trim; will you go in and
speak to them till we get ourselves ready? The cold meat
will do, with a few eggs. I’m sure they could not have
come at a worse time.” Miss Mary accordingly came
hastily in after a few minutes, and received us with a
thousand protestations of welcome. Her mother would
be so truly delighted to see us, for she had fairly given
up all hope of our ever visiting her again. She was just getting
ready, and would be here immediately. “In the
meantime, Mrs Balderstone, you will lay by your cloak and
bonnet. Let me assist you,”—&amp;c. We had got enough,
however, of the Smileses. We saw we had dropped into
the midst of a scene of easy dishabille, and surprised it with
unexpected ceremony. It would have been cruel to the
Smileses to put them about at such a time, and ten times
more cruel to ourselves to sit in friendly intercourse with a
family who had treated us in such a manner behind our backs.
“<em>These Balderstones!</em>” The phrase was wormwood. My
wife, therefore, made up a story to the effect that we had
only called in going home from another friend’s house, in
order to inquire after the character of a servant. As Mrs
Smiles was out of order, we would not disturb her that
evening, but call on some other occasion. Of course, the
more that we declaimed about the impossibility of remaining
to supper, the more earnestly did Miss Smiles entreat
us to remain. It would be such a disappointment to her
mother, and still more to Eliza and the rest of them. She
was obliged, however, with well-affected reluctance, to
give way to our impetuous desire of escaping.</p>

<p>Having once more stepped forth into the cold blast of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
November, we began to feel that supper was becoming a
thing which we could not much longer, with comfort, trust
to the contingency of <em>general invitations</em>. We therefore
sent home our thoughts to the excellent cold duck and
green cheese which lay in our larder, and, picturing to ourselves
the comfort of our parlour fireside, with a good
bottle of ale toasting within the fender, resolved no more
to wander abroad in search of happiness, unless there
should be something like a certainty of good fare and a
hearty welcome elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thus it is always with general invitations. “Do call
on us some evening, Miss Duncan, just in an easy way,
and, pray, bring your seam with you, for there is nothing
I hate so much as ceremonious set calls,” is the sort of
invitations you will hear in the middle ranks of life, given
to some good-natured female acquaintance, while you yourself,
if a bachelor, will in the same way be bidden to call
“just after you are done with business, and any night in
the week; it is all the same, for you can never catch us
unprepared.” The deuce is in these general invitations.
People give them without reflecting that they cannot be at
all times ready to entertain visitors; cannot be so much as
at home to have the chance of doing so. Other people
accept and act upon them, at the risk of either putting
their visitors dreadfully about, or receiving a very poor
entertainment. The sudden arrival of an unexpected guest
who has come on the faith of one of these delusive roving
invitations, indeed, in many instances, disorganises the
economy of a whole household. Nothing tries a housewife
so much. The state of her larder or cupboard instantaneously
flashes on her mind; and if she do not happen
to be a notable, and, consequently, not a regular curer of
beef, or curious in the matter of fresh eggs, a hundred to
one but she feels herself in an awkward dilemma, and, I
have no doubt, would wish the visitor any where but where
he is. The truth is, by these general invitations you may
chance to arrive at a death or a marriage, a period of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
mourning or rejoicing, when the sympathies of the family
are all engaged with matters of their own.</p>

<p>If people will have their friends beside them, let them,
for the sake of all that is comfortable, give them a definite
invitation at once; a general invitation is much worse than
no invitation at all; it is little else than an insult, however
unintentional; for it is as much as to say that the person
is not worth inviting in a regular manner. In “good”
society, a conventional understanding obtains in the delicate
point of invitations; there is an established scale of
the value of the different meals adapted to the rank of the
invited. I advise all my friends to follow this invaluable
code of civility. By all means let your invitations have a
special reference to time. On the other hand, if a friend
comes plump down with a request that you will favour him
with your company at a certain hour of the day, why, go
without hesitation. The man deserves your company for
his honesty, and you will be sure to put him to no more
trouble than what he directly calculates on. But turn a
deaf ear, if you be wise, to <em>general</em> invitations; they are
nets spread out to ensnare your comfort. Rather content
yourself with the good old maxim, which somebody has
inscribed over an ancient doorway in one of the old streets
of Edinburgh, <span class="smcap">Tecum Habita</span>—<em>Keep at Home</em>.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONFESSORS">CONFESSORS.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">It is a very general impression that the system of auricular
confession was given up at the Reformation. Such is
by no means the case; every man and mother’s son in the
country still keeps his <em>confessor</em>. By this epithet, it may
be guessed, I mean that chief and most particular friend
whom every man keeps about him—who stands his best
man when he is married, and becomes his second when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
fights a duel—his double, in short, or second self—a creature
whom you almost always find with him when you call,
and who either walks under his arm in the street, or is
found waiting for him while he steps into some neighbouring
shop, or, as the case may happen, is waited for by
him.</p>

<p>I make bold to say, there is not a trader any where who
does not keep his confessor. The creature haunts the
shop, till he almost seems the Genius of the Place, to the
grievous prepossession of newspapers, and, what is more
intolerable still, to the exclusive occupation of the ear of
the worthy shopkeeper himself. The evening is the grand
revel-time for confessors of this genus. Between eight and
nine, you see them gathering to the shops of their respective
victims, like fowl to roost. As you pass about nine,
you observe, on looking in, that the discipline and rigour of
shop-life has dissolved. Master, men, and boys, feel the
approach of the moment of emancipation, with a peculiar
salience of thought, alternating with a deep and tranquil
delight. The confessor reigns in the spirit of this glorious
hour, and his laugh, and his joke, and his news, and his
proffered pinch, are listened to, re-echoed, and partaken
of by his devotee, with a pleasure of the keenest nature,
and ominous, you may make sure, of oysters and gin punch
on the way home.</p>

<p>In some shops, confessors cluster like grapes over a
vintner’s door. They block up the way of custom; and
it is evident, in many cases, that the devotee would rather
lose the chance of a penny from a customer, by omitting
opportunities of attack, temptation, and inveiglement, than
lose the joke that is passing in the merry circle of his confessors,
which his ear drinks in as a precious <em>aside</em>, while
he only can spare a mere fragment of his attention—a corner
of one auditory organ—the front shop of his mind—to
the real business before him. In some shops, confessors
get no encouragement before dinner. The broad eye of
garish day, in those fastidious establishments, could no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
more endure such a walking personification of idle gossip,
than a ball-room, at high twelve, could tolerate the intrusion
of a man in a short coat, with a pen stuck in his ear.
But this is by no means the general case; and even in
some instances, where the front shop will not admit of such
an appendage, ten to one but, if the premises were well
ransacked, you would find a specimen of the class snug in
some out-of-the-way corner, filling up the greater part of
his time with a newspaper, but every now and then resorted
to by his votary, in the intervals of actual employment,
like an Egeria receiving the visits of a Numa, and
no doubt administering equally precious counsel.</p>

<p>The more common position of a shopkeeper’s confessor
is a chair opposite the door, whence he may command a
view of all that passes on the street, with a full front inspection
of every individual that makes bold to enter.
Into this chair the confessor invariably glides as a matter
of course. There he sits down, and, throwing one limb
over the other, considers himself entitled to inflict his
company upon the unhappy shopkeeper for any length of
time. He notices, as if he were not noticing, all that goes
on in the premises. Not an order is given for goods, not
a payment made, or a pennyworth sold, but it is seen, and
very likely made the subject of after comment. It is of no
consequence to the confessor what description of customers
enter the place. Were a princess of the blood to come in,
he would keep his seat and his countenance equally unmoved,
and a whole band of ladies, driven in to escape a
shower of rain, will not stir him from the chair, to which
he seems nailed, like the marble prince of the Black Islands,
in the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. The customers
very naturally feel disinclined to patronise a shop which
is thus, as it were, haunted by an evil spirit. “Oh, how I
do hate to enter that shop of Mr Such-a-thing,” says one
young lady to another, “for every thing you do or say is
noticed by that odious person who is always lounging there.”
And in this manner Mr Such-a-thing loses his business,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
almost without the possibility of recalling it. He longs to
discover a means of disposing of the confessor, but he finds
a great difficulty in accomplishing his purpose. He is disinclined
to be churlish to a person to whom he has confessed
himself for years. Still he makes an effort. He grows
cool in his civility, and makes a point of being always busy
on his arrival. Perhaps he has the good luck, at length,
to shake off this pest of his premises; but it is more than
probable that he submits to the terrific infliction for life,
his confessor only leaving him when he is fairly in his
grave. I once knew a dreadful case of confessorship, in
which the shopkeeper had the hardihood to expel his visitant,
and by a plan so ingenious that I think it worth while
to advert to it. The shop contained four chairs, including
the confessional, which stood opposite the door. One day
when the confessor arrived, and, as usual, proceeded to his
seat, he was a little surprised in remarking that it was filled
to a pretty good height with parcels of some kind or other.
But as this appeared naturally enough to be caused by a
press in the stock of goods, no observation took place regarding
it, and another chair was selected. However, next
day when he again appeared, another chair was found
covered up in a similar manner. The following day, he even
found a third filled with parcels; and on the fourth day
the whole were thus engaged. The confessor now saw
that a conspiracy had been formed to destroy his functions,
and to expel him from his ancient settlements. Like the
unhappy antediluvians, who, as the flood arose, were
driven from one spot of earth to another, and at last did
not find a dry piece of ground whereon to rest their foot, so
the unhappy confessor had been driven from chair to chair,
till at last he could not discover a place whereon he could
plant himself. A pang of vexation shot through his heart;
a gleam of mingled shame and indignation passed over his
countenance; and, with a last look of despair, he burst
from the shop, and “ne’er was heard of more.”</p>

<p>It must be allowed that some men do not stand so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
in need of confessors, or do not indulge so much in them,
as others; but, upon the whole, it may be taken as a
general rule, that no man can altogether do without such
an official. In the fair on-going business of life, one acts
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suo more solito</i>, according to one’s regular custom of trade,
or by the common rules of the world. But occasions occur,
where common practice does not furnish a rule. You
are in love, and wish to interest a friend in your passion;
you are about to marry, and require information about arrangements,
and also some one to stand beside you, and
pull off your glove, preparatory to the ceremony; you have
a quarrel, and need a third party to tell you that you are
in the right; you are about to enter into some commercial
or other enterprise a little beyond your usual depth, and
find it necessary to fortify your resolution by the sanction
of a friend; or you write a poem or a novel, and require
to have somebody to read the manuscript, and tell you that
it is sure of success. In all these cases, the confessor is
indispensable. <em>Without him</em>, you would be crossed in love;
get stranded in the straits of matrimony; permit yourself,
after giving offence and insult, to let off the object of it
with impunity for his remonstrance; break down in your
new business scheme; and let your manuscript waste its
sweetness on the desert scrutoire. But <em>with him</em> all goes
smooth.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it is better that one’s confessor should
be a little poorer, as well as a little more plausible in speech,
than one’s self: he ought to be a man to whom meat and
drink are things of some account—a broken-down Scotch
licentiate—an author who has published respectable books
which have never sold; in short, some idle, poor, servile
individual, to whom it is of the last importance to
get a good grazing ground in the back premises of a substantial
trader, upon whom he may revenge that partiality
of fortune, which decrees all the real comforts of life to
the mercantile and common-place, while the real “clever
fellows” starve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>But, after all, it must be allowed that there is a great
deal of confessorship in the world, independent of a regard
to cake and pudding. It is in many cases simply a fascination
exerted over one mind by another; in others, the
result of that very common failing, the want of confidence
in one’s own resources. Young men—by which, I mean
men in the mason-lodge time of life, say between twenty
and five-and-twenty—are most apt to indulge in confession.
<em>They</em> think friends all in all, and for friends would give up
every thing. All business and duty is to them an episode,
only consented to because it is unavoidable; while the enjoyment
of the countenance of their friends seems the main
and true concern of life. Then are the joys of confession
truly relished. Then does the vampire confessor suck
deepest into the vitals of his devotee. Happy delusion—sweet
morning dream—alas! too certain to awake to the
conviction that it is “but a dream!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_CHAPTER_OF_POLITICAL_ECONOMY">A CHAPTER OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,<br>
<span class="fs80">WRITTEN FOR THE BRITISH PEASANTRY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The monstrous absurdity, that there is a principle in the
economy of nature by which population increases beyond
the means of support, has been stated by men eminent in
various departments of political economy, and countenanced
by individuals in whom the soundest reasoning and farsightedness
might have been expected. There is <em>not</em> a
principle in nature having a tendency to increase population
beyond the means of subsistence, or to overpeople the
world. To suppose that there is, is to impugn the magnificent
designs of the Creator, and to call in question his
vigilant and ever-sustaining providence. When the globe
which we inhabit, and all that it sustains in the animal and
vegetable kingdoms, was called into existence, and sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
forth fresh from the hands of its Divine Constructor, certain
fixed principles were ordained and put into unintermitting
action, by which all were to be sustained, and
prevented alike from coming to a stand, or into collision.
These principles involved the production and reproduction
of food for man and beast through an incalculable series of
ages; and this process of production was left to be excited
or retarded in a great measure by man, for whose convenience
all subordinate parts were organised, and by whose
thinking faculties the increase or decrease of food was apparently
to be proportioned. In a word, it was left to our
free-will whether to cultivate the soil, or leave it in its rude
and unproductive condition.</p>

<p>It has happened in the course of some five or six thousand
years after the creation of the world, that a small
island, lying in the seas which border on the northern part
of Europe—a spot of earth so comparatively small that it
may be traversed from one end to the other in the space of
little more than a week—has, by the artificial state of its society,
and a concourse of injudicious regulations, increased
in its population to about seventeen millions of inhabitants;
and because, as must necessarily be the case from the influence
of these regulations, a number of the people are in
impoverished circumstances, and are not so well fed as
their neighbours, it has, forsooth, pleased a few men in
this large mass of humanity to impeach the God of the
universe, and to tell us that He creates millions of thinking
beings only to put them to death by starvation.</p>

<p>To show the utter fallacy of this detestable theory, I
need only bring under your notice two simple facts, in
which all such vicious and shallow-minded reasoning finds
an insurmountable obstacle to its establishment. It is a
great, a comforting, and an undeniable fact, that there are
immense tracts of land, islands, and even continents, which
till this hour are lying in nearly their primeval state, with
the soil untouched since the beginning of the world. So
boundless are these almost uninhabited territories, so capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
are they of sustaining human life, that, if the proper
means were used, they would yield food, clothing, and a
place of residence to more people than all that the ancient
settlements of the human race at present contain. They
could hold all the existing population of the earth, and not
be filled. Canada itself could receive and maintain the
whole of the population of Europe; and the seventeen
millions of human beings belonging to the little island which
has raised such alarm, might be transported to the banks
of one of the mighty rivers in the United States, and it
would hardly be known that they had taken up their residence
in the country. “Send us over your whole population
(says an American writer); we have plenty of room
for you all, and a hundred millions more.” But such a
gratifying fact as this gives but a faint idea of the vastness,
the capabilities of the world beyond the waters of the Atlantic.
In one of the numbers of the Journal, I presented
the account given by the ingenious naturalist Audubon,
of the wild pigeons of America. Have my readers any recollection
of the extraordinary number of these animals,
and the calculation made regarding the quantity of their
daily food? Let me here repeat and extend the calculation.
The number of pigeons seen on the wing by Audubon,
as computed by allowing two pigeons to the square
yard, was <em>one billion, one hundred and fifteen millions, one
hundred and thirty-six thousand</em>, and “as every pigeon (says
he) daily consumes fully half a pint of food, the quantity
necessary for supplying this vast multitude must be <em>eight
millions seven hundred and twelve thousand bushels per day</em>.”
The species of food used is the produce of the trees. We
thus find, that by a moderate calculation a single flock of
pigeons in the back woods of America consumes in one
day as great an amount of food, whether by weight or measure,
as would support the whole seventeen millions of
people in Great Britain for at least a week. The mind is
lost in wonder in contemplation of so magnificent a fact.
The faculty of thought is bewildered in pondering on so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
striking an instance of the astonishing bounty of the great
Author of Nature in providing for the wants of his creatures.
Where, where, may we then ask, have the predicters
of famine been examining the sources of food for
man? On what have their eyes and their thoughts been
fixed, that they have passed over this prospect of inexhaustible
plenty? It would seem that they have never
looked beyond the confines of that little spot of land in the
ocean, which I have alluded to, and whose superabundant
thousands require only to be transferred to that division
on the earth’s surface holding out food, raiment, and residence
for their gratuitous acceptance, in order that society
may right itself.</p>

<p>The above is the <em>first</em> fact I have to offer in the elucidation
of this important question; and I maintain, in direct
opposition to those who have taken a contrary view of the
subject—among whom I am sorry to include persons otherwise
distinguished for the clearness and comprehensiveness
of their views of the social compact—that until the <em>whole</em>
earth has been peopled, and until it can hold no more, it
cannot rationally be said that the means of subsistence are
inadequate for the wants of the population. These means
are no more inadequate than that the produce of a kitchen-garden
is insufficient to support the family to which it belongs;
and if this family be prevented from seeking its
subsistence beyond its garden walls, and so be half starved,
their miserable case is exactly parallel with that of this
over-populated island. Remove, I would say, all restrictions
of a certain description; do not unnaturally foster
population either in a particular part of the country, or at
a particular time; <span class="allsmcap">LET MANKIND ALONE</span>: and, in the same
manner that fluids find their level, so will the redundant
population of Great Britain and Ireland be profitably dispersed
over territories hitherto untrodden by the footsteps
of civilised men.</p>

<p>My <em>second</em> fact is more hypothetical, but not less obvious
to our understanding. It is an old proverbial expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
that “necessity is the mother of invention.”
Now, in this sentiment we discover one of the wisest
provisions of Providence. It is only by necessity that
mankind, in a savage state, are compelled to hunt, or
otherwise toil, for their subsistence. The same feeling
predominates through all the ramifications of civilised society.
In proportion as the necessities of men spur them on
to seek out new means of subsistence, so do these new means
of subsistence open upon their view. If we cast a retrospective
glance upon those steps which society has traced
from its infancy to manhood—from a state of barbaric rudeness
to a condition of luxury and splendour—we invariably
find that all improvements have originated in the wants of
the people; and that, in proportion as they increased in
number, so did they whet their invention, and contrive
additional means of support. It is from this cause that
Scotland, for instance, had no greater overplus of food
when it had only a million of inhabitants than it has now,
when it supports nearly three times the number. Nay, it
had much less food in proportion when it had only a million
of people; and hence it is proved that mankind, by
their inventions and improvements, greatly increase the
means of support beyond the point at which they formerly
stood. The power of seeking out, or inventing, new means
of subsistence, just as the old ones are perceived to be inadequate,
has been actively at work since the beginning of
time, and will operate for the benefit of our race as long
as sun and moon endure. It is in the exercise of this
transcendent faculty of the human mind that we see the
beneficence of the Creator in providing unseen means of
subsistence; and it is in it that we find the cheering hope,
that at no period, however distant, even <em>when</em> the <em>whole</em>
earth shall have been covered with inhabitants, shall mankind
languish for lack of food. As they go on increasing
in number, so will they go on perfecting their contrivances;
every succeeding generation may labour under some new
difficulty, but so will it be endowed with the faculty of releasing
itself from it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DRAMA">THE DRAMA.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Theatricals are said to be losing public favour in almost
every place where they are known, and public writers are
puzzled to account for it.</p>

<p>When the buckle-trade declined some years ago, the
cause was at once seen to be the ascendency of buttons.
But it would appear that the cause of the decline of theatricals,
though almost equally obvious, is more a subject
of dispute. It is only so because the subject is larger, and
composed of more parts. We think, however, that a little
discussion will suffice to show, with equal clearness, what
causes the failure of dramatic amusements, as a part of the
great system of public entertainment.</p>

<p>Taking the middle of the last century as a period when
dramatic exhibitions were generally well attended, let us
inquire what there was in the condition and circumstances
of the theatre at that period to have rendered this a matter
of course. We reply at once, that plays were then as
well written, as well <em>got up</em>, and as well acted, as any picture
was then painted, or any novel or poem written. The
drama was at that time on a perfect level with, or perhaps
even superior to, the current literature of the day, or any
other instrument of public amusement which existed. Nor
was it beneath the standard of the general manners of society.
It exhibited, in a gross enough manner, the vices
of the age; but the people whose vices were exhibited
were rendered insensible by those very vices to the grossness
of the scene.</p>

<p>The theatre is now in quite a different condition from
what it was in then. Whether owing to the want of legislative
enactments, which might encourage literary men in
writing for the theatre, or to some other cause, our dramatic
entertainments are now of a character much beneath
or behind the age. Our acting plays are either the old
stock, displeasing us with the exhibition of obsolete vices;
or modern trash, full of exaggerated character and sentiment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
trusting for success, perhaps, to romantic scenery
and machinery; or literal transcripts of nursery fables. Our
drama, overlooking some better qualities, is, in a great
measure, a compound of childishness, indecency, buffoonery,
and, to no small extent, of profanity; in every
point of view fifty years in taste behind our current fictitious
literature, which, in itself, is susceptible of great
amendment.</p>

<p>In Great Britain the drama has always appealed to the
less serious and virtuous part of the community. At the
time of the civil war, and after the re-establishment of the
theatre at the Restoration, it was altogether a Cavalier
thing, and, like the Cavalier party in general, too apt to
make debauchery a mark of rectitude in politics. This character
it has never entirely shaken off. With the exception
of a certain number of mawkish and tawdry aphorisms
scattered over our modern plays, they still maintain, in
some measure, their old war against the decencies and proprieties
of life. The truth is, the theatre has become so
exclusively resorted to by a less serious part of the community,
that it could hardly attempt to conciliate the other
class, lest, in the vain effort, it lose the customers it has.</p>

<p>If the players thus produce an article of entertainment
inferior both in talent and in taste to the other things which
compete for the business of amusing the public, it is not
to be wondered at that their houses are deserted. For the
crown which at present purchases a night’s entertainment
at the theatre to one member of a family—an entertainment
partly childish, perhaps, and almost certain to be
somewhat immoral—that whole family can be supplied for
a whole month with the best literary productions of the
day from a circulating library, or it can purchase a single
volume, which not only gives it rational entertainment and
instruction for several nights, but remains a constant and
ready instrument for repeating this entertainment and instruction
whenever it is required. If we coolly reflect on
the respective reputations which the drama and literature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
bear in the world, we will find that only a certain number
of people wish well to the former, while the latter is an
object of almost universal attachment and national pride.
The fact is, that the drama has shut itself out by its own
misconduct from the sympathies of half the public, if not
a much larger portion. It is still dabbling in the low vices
and mean order of feelings which prevailed in the reign of
George the Second, or else in the nursery tales which lulled
our cradles; while literature, shooting far ahead, is replete
with the superior virtues and extensive benevolences of
the present age. And not only does <em>literature</em> compete
with the stage. Music, and other accomplishments of private
life, are also now resorted to, for the purpose of furnishing
an innocent amusement to the family circle—an
amusement less attractive, perhaps, than the theatre,
which, with all its errors, has still a powerful inherent
charm, but preferred, nevertheless, as making up in simplicity,
harmlessness, and cheapness, what it wants in the
power of excitement.</p>

<p>When we speak of the stupidity and bad taste of the
plays, we do not enumerate all the disadvantages of the
theatre. As if every thing connected with the establishment
were doomed to be of the same order, we find the
players also exciting disgust in all well-regulated minds by
the strange code of morality which they have been pleased
to set up for themselves. Of course, we do not shut our
eyes to the numerous instances of respectable and well-behaved
actors, which occur nowhere, perhaps, so frequently
as in the minor capital which we inhabit. But, as
we remarked in a former paper, we must not have great
generalities ruined or broken down by unimportant exceptions.
Taken as a whole, the players are a more dissolute
fraternity than the members of any other profession; while
some of them, ranking as the very highest in professional
merit, commit transcendent breaches of the most sacred
moral laws, as if to show how independent they are of all
the rules of decent society. We would not gratify the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
wretched vanity which perhaps is one of the principal
causes of those errors, by mentioning particular cases; but
they are too notorious to require being specified. It is
sometimes set forward as a plea for the extenuation of those
offences, that the life of a player is more beset with temptations
than any other. But what an argument is here
against the whole system of play-acting! Another plea
is, that the public has no business with any thing but the
public appearance of a player—has no right to think of
their private lives; as if a person doing all he can to destroy
the safeguards of domestic happiness by action and
example, were to be equally well treated by society, as a
person who does what is in his power to contribute to its
happiness. Society must, in the eyes of these pleaders,
be a slavish thing indeed, if it is supposed that it must patiently
submit to every insult and injury which it may please
the sublime caprice of a buffoon to inflict upon it. And is
the player judged less leniently than an offender in any
other walk of life? When a tradesman commits an outrage
on public decency, is he cherished on account of it by
society? Is he not scouted for it, exactly as the player is,
or, we should rather say, <em>ought to be</em>—for it can hardly be
said that <em>he</em> is ever condemned for his offences by the regular
friends of the stage, though the theatre is, on his account,
still more resolutely abstained from by the good,
who abstained from it before.</p>

<p>If the players thus debase themselves by the impurity of
their lives, and thereby render themselves unfit to be looked
upon or listened to by the majority of society—if they continue
to represent dramas suited to the taste of a past age,
or else adapted only to the sympathies of children—if they
persist in retaining about their whole system vicious forms
of speech, indelicate gestures, and a code of moral feeling
and action, all of which have long been pronounced intolerable
in good society, how can they expect their theatres
to be so prosperous as they once were, more especially
when purer and better modes of entertainment are every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
where rising into competition with them? The person
who pens these thoughts is by no means an enemy to theatricals
in the abstract. With the most respectful deference
to those who see in dramatic entertainments an
express hostility to the divine law, he retains the conviction
that they might be rendered as good and innocent a
means as any other for producing that great end—the diversion
of the public mind by amusement from the follies
and vices of absolute vacuity. He does not consider the
theatre, or any other amusement, so much with a reference
to the good which it may do, as with respect to the evil
which it may prevent. It is clear, however, that the really
good and pure can never become the friends of the theatre,
so long as it remains unreformed. There must be a combination
among the virtuous actors to exclude the vicious
from their body. A number of antiquated and absurd fashions
of the stage must be brought nearer to the standard
of ordinary natural life. And the best literary men of the
day must be encouraged by legislative enactments to produce
a crop of new plays with a stronger moral bent than
the generality of those now existing. Till all this is done,
and the theatre become as noted in public fame for a friendliness
to what is good, as it has hitherto been for the reverse,
it must be content to occupy its present degraded
place amongst our prevailing modes of public entertainment.</p>

<p class="no-indent">If you be a person that have lived for a long time in any
large town, you must have ere this felt the dreadful inconvenience
of knowing and being known by every body. The
courtesy of society demands that, on meeting any one in
the street, of whom you have the slightest acquaintance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
you must <em>not</em> “affect to nod,” like Alexander, but give a
real <em>bona fide</em> nod, or, if you please, a bow, as a mark of
respect or regard—a practice which leads to a thousand
disagreeable sensations in the day, till at last you almost
resolve that your progress shall be like that of a British
war-chariot—<span class="allsmcap">CUTTING</span> right and left, without regard to
man, woman, or child. It is not that you have any abstract
disinclination to pay this tribute to friendship; it is
the frequency and the iteration of the thing that annoys
you. You could tolerate, perhaps, a certain number of
nods in the day—<em>I</em> would willingly compound for twenty—and
it would be all very well if you only met a friend on
the street once in the month or so. But this is not the
way of it: you cannot be abroad two hours (supposing that
you are of long standing in the town) without meeting fifty
people and upwards, to whom you must “vail your haughty
head,” and, what is worst of all, the half of these are people
whom you met and nodded to yesterday, and the day
before, and every day before that again, back to the creation
of the world. With many of these persons, your acquaintance
at first was of the very slightest nature. You
met the man in a steam-boat, and had your respective
names mentioned by a friend. You left a room one day
as he was entering, and you were introduced, and, after exchanging
only three words, made a friendly bow to each
other, and parted. Perhaps he was introduced to you
passingly on the street by some person to whom you had
been introduced several years before, in the same transient
way, by an individual whose acquaintance of you was originally
of so slight a character that you had even then forgot
for some years how it commenced. Your reminiscences
upon the whole subject are a Generation of Shadows,
traced back to Nothing. Possibly you sat next to him one
night, “consule Planco,” at a mason-lodge, and to this
blessed hour have never so much as learned his name.
When it happens that you do not see or meet these acquaintances
for six months after your first rencontre, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
affair has by that time got cool enough to justify you mutually
in cutting each other. But in most cases it happens
quite differently. On the very morning, perhaps, after
having scraped acquaintance with a merry fellow in some
promiscuous company, you meet him going abroad, like
yourself, to his place of business. As nothing of the world,
or its concerns, has as yet got between you and your recollections
of last night’s conviviality, you pull up with him
for a minute, shake hands, laugh cordially in each other’s
faces, hope each other is quite well after yesternight’s business,
remark what a deal of fun there was, what a deuced
funny fellow that was who sung the comic songs, and so
forth; and then, with another cordial shake of each other’s
hands, you part off, each to the serious duties of the day.
Unfortunately, it happens that this new acquaintance of
yours has to go to his place of business exactly at the same
time in the morning with yourself, and that your places of
residence and business are co-relatively in opposite situations.
It is, therefore, your doom to cross each other’s
path regularly every morning at ten minutes before ten, for
all the rest of your natural lives. Your eyes begin to open
upon this appalling fact on the second day. You meet your
man <em>then</em>, exactly at the same spot as on the morning before;
when, the conviviality of the penult evening being
totally spent, both in respect of its effect on your mind,
and as a subject of conversation, you stand in an agony of
a minute’s duration, talking to each other of you know not
what, till, fortunately, perhaps, a friend comes up who is
going your way, and you hook yourself upon him, and take
a hurried leave of your new acquaintance. Next morning
you content yourself with shaking your friend by the hand
cordially without stopping. Next morning, again, the affair
has degenerated into a laughing nod. Next, it is an
ordinary nod; at which point it continues ever after, till it
is evident to both of you, as you approach each other, that
you are beginning to be fairly tired of existence, and wish,
mutually, that it were all well over with you, so far as this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
breathing world is concerned, and the whole affair hushed
up in the silence of the grave.</p>

<p>It is not alone in the monotony of this system of recognition
that the misery lies. You are also put to a great
deal of pain and difficulty, in many cases, by the rank of
the individuals to be recognised. Every man of the world
has occasion to be brought into contact now and then with
persons superior to himself, but who do not scruple to make
themselves familiar with him in his own house or place of
business. Now, the plague is, how to treat these people
on the street. If their rank be very far above your own,
the case is comparatively easy; for a bow, with an elevation
of the hat, is readily awarded on your part, and graciously
received on his. But should his place in society be
just a little above your own, or such as you expect to attain
very speedily—or should he be just a little longer started
in the general race of prosperity than yourself—then it is
perplexing indeed. Man has no antipathy to the brother
worms who are so far beneath his own level as never to be
brought into contrast with him. A nobleman is quite at
his ease with his tailor. But it is very different with the
individuals who are just a little lower than ourselves, and
liable to be confounded with us. We could tolerate the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">profanum et ignobile vulgus</i> itself, rather than the people
whose manners and circumstances in life are but one step beneath
our own. Hence, one is liable to perpetual grievances
on the street, through, what he thinks, the forwardness of
some people, and the haughtiness of others. Alternately
cutting and cut, on he goes, in a state of unhappiness beyond
all description. Sometimes he avoids recognizing,
through fear of its being offensive, a person who was fondly
anxious to have his nod, and takes it very ill that he does
not get it. Sometimes he is in the reverse predicament, and
proffers a condescending bow, or intends to do so, to one
who, putting quite a different construction on their respective
degrees of consequence, coolly overlooks him.</p>

<p>In short, what with one thing and another, walking on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the street is an exceedingly disagreeable exercise. For
my part, having been long connected with the city I inhabit,
I am obliged to take a thousand ingenious expedients
in order to get along with any degree of comfort.
For one thing, I would sooner walk some miles barefooted
over broken glass, than parade on the principal streets of
the city at high twelve. If I were to attempt a passage
that way, I might go as I have been told Oechlenschlager
the Danish poet does through the streets of Copenhagen,
my hat in my hand, and my body in a perpetual inclination.
I have to seek all possible kinds of by-ways,
through alleys profound and obscure; and when I cross a
thoroughfare, it is with the same dogged straight-forward
look with which a man swims across a dangerous river.
When I do happen, in a moment of facility or confidence,
to venture upon an open street, I have all kinds of expedients
for avoiding and diminishing the pains of recognition.
When you see an acquaintance approaching, you
must consider the relative circumstances. Much depends
on the place of meeting—much on the time—much on the
crowded or empty state of the streets, and much, of course,
on the degree of your intimacy with him, and the distance
of time since you last met. If it be a vacant street, and
not a business time of the day, and six months since you
last met him, you are in for a quarter of an hour’s palaver
as sure as you live, and hardly even a parting <em>then</em>, unless
you can either of you manage to get up a good witticism,
under cover of which you may escape. If the street be
crowded, and the time a busy one, you are tolerably safe,
even although it should have been a twelvemonth since
you met before. In this case, you fly past with a hurried
nod, which seems to say, “We are busy just now, but will
have another opportunity of stopping to speak.” This is
a nod of adjournment, as it were, and it is one of great
satisfaction to both parties, for both argue, of course—though
they don’t put that into the nod—that, as it is a
twelvemonth since they last met, it may be another before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
they meet again. Should you meet a man in a vacant
street, even in the busiest part of the day, then the former
circumstance annuls the latter, and you must stand and
deliver, even although you be too late for an appointment
of the most interesting character. On the other hand, if
you meet your man in the leisurely part of the day, in a
crowded street, you get off with a nod, pretending to yourself
that you are carried away by the current. Sometimes
you may not take advantage of your good fortune in this
last case, but so bring it about that you get into collision
with your friend, and begin a conversation. In this case,
even although you have only asked him how he does—not
caring in the least what he has to answer—and though you
positively have not another idea to interchange with him,
he finds it necessary to disengage himself from the throng
in order to reply. You now get upon the curb-stone, or
upon the causeway, where, of course, you have no more
advantage from the crowded state of the street than a fish
has of a river after it has been thrown upon the bank. You
are now in the same predicament as if you had met your
friend in the same cool part of the day <em>in a perfectly empty
street</em>, and therefore, when he has answered your precious
question as to his health, you are as fairly in for a quarter of
an hour of wretched, bald, wishy-washy conversation about
all kinds of nothings that you don’t care one farthing about,
as ever you were in your life. The only thing that can now
save you is either a joke to laugh yourselves asunder upon,
a crowd raised at a distant part of the street by some such
matter as a child ridden over by a coach, or else, what is not
a bad means of separation, though sometimes dangerous, you
cut off one grievous encumbrance by taking on another; that
is, you see another friend coming up your way, and, pretending
you have something to say to him, shake off the
old love and take on with the new: in which case it is not
improbable that you spend longer time at the end of the
street with this last individual than you might have had to
spend with the former one if you had continued with him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
and only given the other man a passing nod; but, of course,
that is all the fortune of war, and, having done what seemed
best under the circumstances, you must rather blame fate
than your own imprudence. Consider well, however, in
such a case, whether you are likely to get soonest off with
the new or the old love; for if you take on with a bore of
ten minutes’ power, in order to get off with one of only
five, merely because he is going your way, and promises
no interruption in the first instance, you may only fall
into Scylla, seeking to avoid Charybdis.</p>

<p>After all, as in every matter arising from the affairs of
this world, a great deal of our happiness, so far as it is
concerned by the system of recognition, lies with ourselves.
If we are prudent, and take counsel from experience,
we may avoid much of this nodding and bowing
misery which would otherwise fall to our share. A man,
for instance, should not be always goggling and staring
about him; otherwise he will be sure to fall in with flying
nods, which he could as well dispense with, if he does
not even hit some person, perhaps, on the other side of
the way, who, not having seen him for a long time, thinks
it is duty—Lord confound him!—to come across the
Hellespont of mud, and shake the spirits out of him with
half an hour of tediousness and common-place. When
you debouch from your door, never look along the street
in the direction you are not to travel, or ten to one but
you see some one who, having the infelicity, poor devil, to
catch your eye, must put himself on to a canter to come
up to you; and so you get mutually entangled, perhaps for
half the day. I give this caution with a particular emphasis;
for I have observed that nine out of every ten men
look back in the way described, as if it were one of the involuntary
motions or inclinations of human nature. As
you are walking along, never cast your regards upon any
one coming obliquely across the street, or in all probability
you are shot dead by an eye of your acquaintance, which,
if it had not hit you, would have passed on innocuous. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
eye is the principal mischief in all these cases. A man is
often snared by that part of him, and dragged a hundred
yards along a dirty street, for all the world like a silly salmon
hooked by the nose, and laid, after half a mile of
tugging and hauling, exhausted on the shore. Keep your
eye well to yourself, and you are tolerably safe; for of
this you may be assured, no man will come up to attract
your attention, unless he be a country cousin, who was
just looking about for you. Every mother’s son of them
is actuated by the same principles with yourself, and is glad
to escape all the nodding he can. So reciprocal is this
feeling, that many persons whom you are taking means to
avoid, will, if you observe them narrowly, be found to
be doing all they can to assist in the process. If you pretend,
for instance, that you cannot see that gentleman there
coming aslant the way, on account of the intense brightness
of the sun, you will see out at the tail of your eye
that he is pretending to be as much put about by the
sunshine as yourself, and is doing all he can to shade his
eyes from Phœbus and you, exactly in the same fashion
with yourself. If you walk, as you ought to do, with your
eyes fixed below what painters call the point of sight, but
suddenly raise them for a moment, in order to look about
you, it is ten to one but you see your very bosom friend—your
confessor—the man whom you wear in your heart of
hearts—in the act of sneakingly withdrawing his eye from
your countenance, for the purpose of getting past you unnoticed.
Take no scorn on account of these things, but
put it all down rather to the strength of friendship; for
can there be any stronger test of that sentiment, than the
desire of saving those whom we love from any thing that
is disagreeable to them?</p>

<p>It has been already remarked, that if you be in the regular
habit of meeting and nodding to a person every now
and then, the system is kept up till death do you part.
On the other hand, if you can avoid seeing a person for
some considerable time, the nod becomes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">efféte</i>, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
ever after see, as if you saw not, each other. Sometimes,
however, one gets a great relief in the midst of a fixed and
hopeless nodding acquaintance, by happening to meet once
more at the social board in some friend’s house, when you
re-invigorate the principle, gather fresh intimacy, and perhaps,
after all, take refuge from the unnecessary monotony
of nodding terms in a serious friendship.</p>

<p>If you can help yourself by this means, it may be all
very well, though certainly it is rather hard that one
should be forced into an intimacy with a man merely because
he crosses your path rather oftener than the most
of your other slight acquaintances. The best way, however,
to lessen this part of the evils of life, is to walk with
<em>as little circumspection as possible</em>. So ends my preachment
about <span class="smcap">Recognitions</span>.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Jock Colquhoun was a clever journeyman painter of the
famous Old Town of Edinburgh, very much given, unfortunately,
to Saturday evening potations, which was the
cause why he never found himself, poor fellow, any richer
one Monday than another, and generally lived during the
rest of the week in, to say the least of it, a very desultory
manner. Jock was a long slip of a lad, with a bright intelligent
face and a wofully battered hat, and the whole man
of him was encased, from neck to heel, in one glazed suit—I
was going to say, of clothes, but I should rather say,
of oil-paint; for, to tell the truth, his attire consisted rather
more of the one material than the other. He was
universally reputed as a very clever workman; but, then,
every body said, what matters it that he can make five
shillings a-week more than any of his fellow-journeymen,
if he is sure every Saturday, when he gets his wages,
<em>to go upon the scuff</em>, and so pass the half of the week in
spending, not in gaining? Jock, however, had many good
points about him; and it was, perhaps, less owing to his
own dispositions than to the influence of evil company,
that he got into such bad habits. He was such a good
fellow that he would at any time part his money with an
old crony out of bread, or treat to a can or a bottle any
working brother who had got through his money a little
before him, and who happened to feel rather dry upon
some sunshiny Wednesday. In his profession he was
matchless at all superior kinds of work. If his employers
had any thing to do that required an extraordinary degree
of taste or dexterity, Jock was set to it, and he invariably
managed it (beer and whisky aside) to their entire satisfaction.
Jock might have long ago been foreman to his
masters: nay, he might have set up as a general artist,
and, with perseverance equal to his talent, would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
been sure to do well. But gill-stoups were his lions in the
way, and the deceitfulness of drink had beset him; and
Jock, from year to year, was just the same glazed and battered,
but withal rather spruce-looking fellow, as ever.</p>

<p>It would have been altogether impossible for any such
man as Jock to carry on the war, if he had not had one
howff,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> above all others, where he enjoyed a little credit.
This was an eating-house in the Canongate, kept by one
Luckie Wishart, a decent widow of about forty, with four
or five children, who had been pleased to cast an eye of
particular favour upon the shining exterior of our hero.
A pot sable upon a ground argent pointed out this house
to the passers by, even if they had not been informed of
its character by the savoury steam which always proceeded
from it between the hours of one and five <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, and certain
spectral and unfinished pies which ran in a row along
the sole of her little window, level with the street, as well
as a larger display of the same article on a board half way
down her somewhat steep and whitewashed stair. Luckie
Wishart also sold liquors; but she was far too respectable
a person to let Jock spend his wages at one bouse in her
house. She always, as she said, shanked him off, whenever
he came there of a Saturday night, and it was only
when his pockets were empty, and no provisions to be had
for the working days of the week, that he resorted to her.
Generally about the Tuesdays, Jock came briskly down
into her culinary Tartarus, quite sobered and hungry,
sending his voice briskly along the passage before him, as
if defending himself by anticipation from a shower of reproaches
which he knew she would bestow upon him:—“Nothing
of the kind,” he would cry; “nothing of the
kind—all a mistake—’pon my honour.” There was generally,
it may be supposed, fully as much scolding and railing
as he could have anticipated; but the end of the jest
always was, that Jock got snug into some corner of Luckie’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
own particular den, where he was regaled with a plate of
something or other, garnished always with a few last words
of rebuke from the lady, like the droppings after a thunderstorm,
which he always contrived, however, to stomach
with his beef, without manifesting any very great degree
of irritation. There is something ominous in the act of
drawing in one’s stool at the fireside of a comfortable widow.
It is apt to make a young man feel rather ticklish,
even although he may never have thought of her before,
except as a good cook. So it was with Jock, and the idea
might have been fatal to his visits to Luckie Wishart’s (for,
to speak the truth, she was no great beauty), if dire hunger,
which tames lions, had not absolutely compelled him
to continue the practice. In general, when Jock came in
with his week’s gains, he flung a few shillings upon the
dresser, as part payment of what he had ate and drank
during the past few days, reserving the rest for the bouse-royal.
But, notwithstanding all these occasional deposits
to account, his score got always the longer the longer, until
it at last went fairly off at the bottom of a cupboard door,
and had to be “brought forward” on the end of a chest of
drawers.</p>

<p>“That’s a shocking bad hat you’ve got,” said Luckie to
him one day, without any idea that she was anticipating a
favourite English phrase by some years. “Of course,
there’s nae chance of such a drucken blackguard as you
ever being able to buy a new ane. But what wad you
say, John, if I were to gie ye ane mysel’?”</p>

<p>“I would say, much oblige t’ye, ma’am,” answered Jock,
now for the first time in his life called by his proper Christian
name.</p>

<p>“Here is one, then,” said the widow, and at the same
time produced a decent-looking chapeau, which, she said,
had belonged to <em>him that was away</em>—meaning her late husband—and
had only been three times on his head at the
kirk, when, puir man, he was carried without it to the
kirk-yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>Jock accepted the hat with great thankfulness, and made
his old one skimmer into Luckie’s fire, where, it is needless
to say, it was speedily roasted in its own grease.</p>

<p>“Dear sake, Jock, man,” said Mrs Wishart, some days
afterwards, “what kind o’ a landlady hae ye got at hame?
She maun be nae hand at the shirts, I reckon; for fient a
bit can ane ken ye on a Monday frae what ye are on a
Saturday. Ye may be as touzly as ye like i’ the outside o’
your claes, but I wad aye like to see a man decent-like
next the skin.”</p>

<p>“Deed, mistress,” said Jock, “to let ye into a secret, I
have nae great stock o’ linen, and whiles Mrs Ormiston’s
a wee hurried in getting a shirt ready for me. I’m a gude
deal between the hand and the mouth in that respect.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re just the greatest ne’er-do-weel ever I kenned,” replied
Mrs Wishart; “but yet, reprobate as ye are, I canna
think o’ seeing ye gaun that gate frae ae week’s end to anither.
Here’s four gude shirts that I hae unco little use
for now-a-days. Better ye should wear them, than that
they should gang to the moths. Tak them hame wi’ ye,
man, and mak yoursel’ something trig, and dinna gang to
think that I’m aye to be gi’ing ye the buffet without the
bite.”</p>

<p>Jock did as he was bid, and towards the end of the
week Luckie Wishart asked him “if he ever thought o’
taking a walk on a Sunday evening wi’ his lass to Restalrig,
to treat her wi’ curds and cream, or ony thing o’ that
kind?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay I have, mistress,” said Jock, “in my
day. But,” added he, looking askance at his resplendent
sleeves, “somehow or other I’ve fallen out of a suit of
Sunday claes, and, of course, nae lass ’ll gang wi’ a chiel
like a beggar.”</p>

<p>“Weel, Jock,” said the lady, “I think ye canna do
better than just step into my auld gudeman’s claes bodily,
and let us hae nae mair wark about it.”</p>

<p>This was accompanied with a look so significant, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
Jock could not pretend to misunderstand it. He all at once
felt as if the stool which he had drawn in towards the fireside
was burning under him, while all the burnished covers
on the opposite wall looked like so many moons dancing
in troubled water. “Od, mistress,” he stammered out,
“are ye serious?”</p>

<p>“Ay, that I am,” answered she; “and dinna let your
modesty wrang ye, my man, an’ ye be wise. Ye see every
thing here ready to your hand; and if ye just be steady a
bit, as I’m sure ye will be, wi’ me to look after baith your
meat and your winnings, ye may be the snuggest painter
lad in the town. What wi’ what <em>ye</em> can make, and what
wi’ what <em>I</em> can make, we’ll be very weel, or I’m muckle
mista’en.”</p>

<p>“But, Luckie,” said Jock, “I maun get my ain consent
first; and that, I’m feared, it’ll not be sae easy to get.
There was a lass ——”</p>

<p>“Oh, very weel, John,” said Mrs Wishart; “of course
ae man may lead a horse to the water, but twenty winna
gar him drink. There’s some folk that dinna ken what’s
gude for them, and ye’re ane o’ them. But see, lad,” she
added, opening up the cupboard door, “what a score ye
hae here! Twa pounds fifteen shillings and eightpence.
When will ye be gaun to pay that?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I maun pay’t when I can,” said Jock, striding
sturdily up stairs into the street.</p>

<p>Next day he was served with a summons to the sheriff’s
court for two pounds fifteen shillings and eightpence, and
as he never appeared to dispute the claim, a writ was allowed
against him, warranting either the incarceration of
his person, or the distraining of his goods. Goods Jock
had none; his person therefore came into immediate request
among certain individuals of whose companionship
he was not ambitious. It would be vain to tell all the
strange miracles by which he was enabled for some weeks
to elude the pursuit instituted against him. Sometimes
as the officers were entering at the door, he was escaping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
by the back window. Once he had to drop himself down
two stories into an alley. At another time, he sprang
across a gulf about ten feet wide, between two garret windows,
nine floors from the ground. This course of life
could not continue long. He could not get rest any where
to pursue his ordinary business, and of course he soon
found himself upon very short allowance both as to meat
and drink. Just at this crisis, Jock heard of an expedition
which was about to sail from Leith, for the purpose of colonising
Poyais, and through the intervention of an old
chum, who was going thither, he was permitted to join
the corps. On the night before the vessel was to sail, he
skulked down to Newhaven, and got on board along with
the family of his friend. He now, for the first time during
three weeks, found himself, as he thought, safe from the
avenging persecution of Luckie Wishart. For one happy
night he slept amidst a parcel of sacks in a corner of the
cabin, surrounded on all hands by squalid and squalling
children, whose cries, however, were nothing to the dread
which he had recently entertained for the fell Dido of the
Canongate. Next morning, the sun rose bright, the sails
were set loose, the heart of every man on board beat high
with hope, and Jock’s bosom’s lord sat lightly on his throne—when,
oh manacles and fetters! a boat came alongside,
containing a whole bevy of sheriff’s officers. Jock now
thought that it was all over with him; for, simple man, he
believed that he was the sole individual in request. The
case, however, was quite different. On a demand being
made for admission into the vessel, the whole of the passengers,
with one consent, raised their voices against it.
“What! let these fellows in!—as well give up the whole
expedition!” The officers pleaded to have at least a representative
sent on board, to show their case to the captain,
which, after a great deal of difficulty, was consented
to. One messenger was accordingly hoisted on board, and
proceeded to call the names of the persons for whom they
had captions—Jock Colquhoun among the number. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
personalities of this kind were not to be endured. The
passengers rose in absolute mutiny against the captain, demanded
that he should instantly proceed on the voyage,
even although one member of the expedition was yet to
join; and as they feared to let the boat once more approach
the vessel, they insisted that the messenger should be retained
where he was, and carried out to Poyais and back
again, as a punishment for his temerity. It was a mad
affair altogether, and so small an addition to the general
frenzy was of little moment. So the boatswain, or somebody
else, “gave the dreadful word,” and, notwithstanding
all the remonstrances of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">detenú</i>, which were both loud
and vehement, the lessening boat of the officers was soon
seen unwillingly rowing to land, while, instead of any white
hand to wave adieu to those on board, the fist of big Pate
Forsyth, the chief of the fraternity, was observed shaking
in impotent rage over the stern, as much as to say to the
captain, “If ever you come back to Leith, ye ken what
ye’ll get.”</p>

<p>Jock soon found himself tolerably comfortable in his new
situation. He had, no doubt, come on board without
much luggage, and he was still the same greasy Pict as
ever in respect of his attire. But then he was not, after
all, much behind his neighbours; for if ever a fit garrison
for the care of Adullam was collected since the days of
King David, it was this ship’s company. The whole set
resembled a troop of strolling players, going to act a grand
historical drama in some country town. A gentleman in
tartan trousers was to be a kind of Cincinnatus, alternating
between the plough and the cares of state. A young lad,
in a blue bonnet, was to be Chamberlain, and Supreme
Director of Literature and the Arts. Another carried with
him all the materials of a bank, except credit and specie.
The other <em>characters</em> and <em>properties</em>, to speak theatrically,
were all on the same scale; and if a state could have been
founded as easily as a castle of cards is built, or a puppet-show
set in motion, Poyais could have immediately taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
its place among the nations of the earth. In such a system
it was easy to find a place for Jock. The Chamberlain
was good enough to divest himself, in favour of this new
friend, of that part of his commission which referred to the
fine arts. Jock was therefore styled from this day forward,
Director Colquhoun; and every one, including himself,
agreed that the case could have only been improved, if he
had happened to have any paints. However, nobody pretended
to doubt that, so far as the fine arts could be cultivated
without materials, Mr Colquhoun would prove
himself an efficient member of the corps.</p>

<p>The voyage was a pleasant one, and during the whole
time nothing was to be heard in the vessel but pæans of
homage and gratitude to the Cazique Macgregor, who had
sent them out to take possession of his territories. The
only individual who did not partake of the general joy was
the poor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">detenú</i>, whose long gaunt person did not agree
with a tropical climate, and who, therefore, sickened, and
threatened to die before reaching the land. It was in
vain that the Chamberlain promised to make him Lord
High Constable of the Kingdom, if he would only keep up
his spirits. Like the poor sparrow, who, in its last moment,
refuses the very finest crumbs held to its mouth, he
said it was all humbug to make him these offers, when it
was clear he could never live in such a hot part of the
world as this. He would lay his death, he said, to their
door, and, if at all possible, he would be sure to haunt
them after death. To the great grief of the company, the
unfortunate messenger died on the very day when they cast
anchor off the shores of Poyais.</p>

<p>About seventy or eighty individuals, from the Old Town
of Edinburgh—forming the staff of a great empire—now
landed on a flat bushy part of the Mosquito Territory—ominous
name!—in the Bay of Honduras, with the expectation
of immediately falling into the enjoyment of all the
luxuries and pleasures which this world can bestow. They
were, indeed, somewhat surprised to find that every thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
was still in its primeval state, and that even their houses
were as yet to be built. However, having found one small
opening in the forest of brushwood, they established themselves
there, with such goods and chattels as they had;
and their first duty was to give a decent burial to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">detenú</i>,
whose body they had brought ashore for that purpose.
A grave having been dug, the Chamberlain, assuming the
character of High Priest of the Kingdom, for want of a
better, mounted an old shirt over his clothes, by way of
sacerdotal vestment, and proceeded to read the funeral
service of the church of England over the body. In the
very middle of the most solemn part of this ceremony, a
large bird, with a curious beaky face, somewhat resembling
that of the deceased, alighted upon a tree immediately above
the funeral group, and cried, with a loud shrill voice, what
was interpreted by all present (with the aid, no doubt,
of a stricken conscience) into the phrase, “Pay your
debt!”</p>

<p>The colonists saw and heard with terror, believing that
the spirit which had lately animated the body before them
was now addressing them in character, according to his
threat before death; and, but for the protection which
daylight always gives to the superstitious, the whole set,
including both the civil and military departments of the
state, would have fled from the spot. The Chamberlain
saw the nature of the case, and drew hurriedly towards
a conclusion; but yet, at every brief pause of his voice,
there still came in the ear-piercing cry, “Pay your debt!”
Before the grave had been closed, another and another
bird of the same species drew towards the spot, and each
lifted up his voice to the same tune—“Pay your debt”—“Pay
your debt”—“Pay your debt”—till the whole forest
seemed possessed by one spirit, and the ghost of the sheriff’s
officer appeared to the distracted senses of the settlers
to have dispersed itself into a whole legion of harpies.
The fact was, that the birds were brought forth by the
coolness of the evening, according to their usual habits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
and were now innocently amusing themselves with their
accustomed cry, without the least idea of any personality
towards the Poyaisians. The Chamberlain of the colonists,
who had learned from books of travels that many
American birds uttered something like a sentence of English
as their habitual cry, endeavoured to assuage the alarm
of his companions; but, nevertheless, a very general sense
of terror remained.</p>

<p>“It may be all very true,” said Jock Colquhoun, “that
the birds of this country have each a particular word to
say; but, od, it’s gayan queer that the Poyais bird should
have pitched upon a thing that jags our consciences sae
sair.”</p>

<p>The first night was spent in a very uncomfortable manner.
To a day of intense heat succeeded a cold dewy
night, which struck the limbs of the unprotected settlers
with such severe cramps, that hardly a man could stir next
morning. Their sleep, moreover, was broken occasionally
by the cry of “Pay your debt!” which a few of their feathered
friends kept up at intervals all night. Next day,
instead of setting about the erection of their metropolis
and sea-port, as was intended, they had to attend each
other’s sick-beds. Before night several of the women and
children had expired. Next day, and the next again, the
same sickness continued; and in less than a week, half
their number were under the earth. Jock, who had fortunately
escaped every mishap except a rheumatic shoulder,
now began to think how much more comfortable he would
have been in Luckie Wishart’s <em>laigh shop</em> in the Canongate
of Edinburgh, than he was on this inhospitable coast,
where there was no prospect of raising so much as a potato
for a twelvemonth. “What a fool I was,” said he, “not
to make my quarters good there, as the honest woman proposed!
Oh, to be walking wi’ her down the King’s Park
on a Sunday nicht, even wi’ a’ the five bairns running after
us! I’se warrant the gardens at Restalrig hae nae birds
about the bushes that tell folk to pay their debt; naething<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
o’ the kind there, unless it be the boord, black letters on
a white ground, that says, ‘Pay on delivery.’”</p>

<p>Hardship had now dispelled from every mind the magnificent
ideas with which they had hitherto been inspired.
If the vessel had yet remained on the coast, the whole of
the surviving company, prime minister and all, would have
willingly exchanged their brilliant appointments under the
Cazique for a snug berth on board. But it had departed
immediately after landing them; and there only remained
the chance that some other vessel would pass that way,
and take pity on their distress. This, fortunately, happened
in the course of a few days. A vessel bound to
Belize came along the shore, and, on a signal from the
unfortunate Poyaisians, sent a boat to inquire into their
case. As only a few remained alive, it was soon arranged
that they should be carried to the port for which the vessel
was bound. With grateful and subdued hearts, and casting
many a mournful glance towards the graves of their
friends, the small remnant of the Poyais expedition betook
themselves to the boat, and sailed off to the vessel. As
a sort of parting admonition, a bird came up at the moment
of their departure from the land, and, pronouncing one
shrill, clear “Pay your debt!” flew off into the interior.</p>

<p>It were needless to relate the various hardships and adventures
which befel Jock Colquhoun before he regained
his native shore. Be it enough, that he immediately
sought the cozy den of Luckie Wishart, and <em>paid his debt</em>
in the way originally desired by the lady, who, under the
name of Mrs Colquhoun, continued for many years, with
the assistance of her reformed husband, to regale the good
people of the Canongate.</p>

<p>“A flichty chield,” she used to remark to her female
friends, “was whyles the better o’ finding the grund o’ his
stamack.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHILDREN">CHILDREN.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">I may begin with the question of Henry the Fourth of
France, when found by an ambassador at romps with his
children, “Are you a father?” If you are, we may go
on with the game—if not, you must pass to the next article.
A curious thing it is, this same fact, that children in
general are only interesting in the eyes of those who are
parents, while brats in particular are held as pests by all
but their immediate father and mother. Some lightheaded
author has compared the rush of children which takes place
at the conclusion of family dinners, to the incursion of the
Goths and Vandals. Perhaps it is all true, that children
out of place are not agreeable; but is any thing agreeable
that is out of place? Children, abstracted from the
homely details of their management, and the anxiety which
they always occasion, are a delightful study—a study, I
maintain, fitted alike to engage the speculations of the philosophic,
and the affections of the benevolent, mind. I
cannot, I must say, form the idea of a man of extended
views and sympathies, who does not like children.</p>

<p>Among the grown-up part of mankind, there is always
abundance of envy, hatred, and all uncharitableness. This
fact I consider with reference to the circumstances in which
men are placed, and I plainly conceive that where existence
is only to be supported by an unceasing struggle, and
where self-love is so perpetually receiving injury, it is
needless to expect that men should be much better than
they are. In children, however, we see no possibility of
any rivalship: they are a harmless little people at <em>this</em>
moment, and we run no chance of being jostled by them
in our course of life, for many years to come. There is,
therefore, no reason for envy, hatred, or uncharitableness
with them. On the contrary, in our intercourse with
children, our self-love is undergoing a perpetual compliment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
The appeal which they are constantly making
from their own silently-confessed weakness, to our tacitly-acknowledged
strength, soothes and delights us. A fellow-creature
lies unconsciously abandoned to our mercy—unconsciously
unable to resist. It asks for nothing, for it
cannot; but it does not expect harm. There is the charm.
It imputes to us none of our original sins of envy, hatred,
and uncharitableness, but seems to take it for granted that
we are blanch and stainless like itself. It puts forth its little
arms to us, with a perfect confidence in our gentler and better
nature, and we feel it impossible to be evil when we are so
sincerely understood to be good. We give, then, the love
and faith that are demanded, and press the offenceless type
of our original and perfect nature, with all the hues and all
the odours of paradise rife around it, to our heart of hearts.</p>

<p>The whole external deportment of a child is delightful.
Its smile—always so ready when there is no distress, and
so soon recurring when that distress has passed away—is
like an opening of the sky, showing heaven beyond. Tales
are told of murderers, who, after revelling in the blood of
many adults, were at length arrested by the smile of a
child, and suddenly became innocent, because they were
supposed to be so. The grasp of its little hand around one
of our fingers—its mighty little crow when excited by the
playfulness of its nurse—its manful spring upon the little
woolpack legs that refuse to bear its weight—are all traits
of more or less pleasantness. Then, the eye of a child—who
can look unmoved into that “well undefiled,” in
which heaven itself seems to be reflected? Whether the
gem be of sweet pellucid blue, or of the mysterious and
unsearchable black, what meanings unexpressed, unintelligible,
reside within! the germ of a whole life of feelings
and ideas. Human nature is familiar in all its bearings to
most men; yet how novel does every symptom of it appear,
as first shown forth by a child! Every little imperfect
function—every step in the attainment of physical
power—every new trait of intelligence, as they one by one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
arise in the infantine intellect, like the glory of night, starting
star by star into the sky, is hailed with a heart-burst
of rapture and surprise, as if we had never known any
thing so clever or so captivating before. The point thus
gained is never lost. The darling child is reminded perpetually
of the idea he lately seemed to comprehend, or of
the word he seemed nearly able to pronounce, or of the
little action he attempted to perform; and thus the whole
of his little stock of accomplishments is carefully kept together,
liable to a constant increase. Hosannas of affection
celebrate every step of his progress towards maturity,
and fresh blessings are showered upon his holy and harmless
head, for every manifestation of the presence of the
godlike mind. Nor is this interest in his advance confined
to those whose daily joy it is to fold him to the
beatings of a kindred heart. Almost every one who has
occasion to observe the march of infant intellect feels an
instinctive satisfaction in the contemplation. It seems,
indeed, to be part of the grand and wise design, that all
the mature of the human race should be concerned respecting
the progress of the young: it is the silent working
of nature towards the general good. Without a principle
of this kind constantly at work—and it <em>is</em> always at work,
in the attentions of the reflecting and grave, as well as in
the apparently senseless prattle of the nurse—the moral
world would be in danger of standing still.</p>

<p>The love of parents for their children—so far as it is not
a sentiment arising from the contemplation of beauty, or
innocence, or helplessness—is a kind of self-love. Yet no
one ever thinks of imputing to a parent, as a fault, that he
has a high appreciation of his children. The truth is,
though in one sense self-love, it is, in another, the most
generous and self-abandoning feeling in nature. The world
is also aware instinctively, that the fondness of parents for
their children is necessary for their protection and education;
and, therefore, if there were no other palliation of
the passion, it would at least be convenient. In virtue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
these excuses, a parent can indulge in all the pleasures of
the most intense, devoted, devouring, self-appreciation,
and yet have none of the usual reproach attending it. He
can admire himself in his children, to a greater extent than
ever did Narcissus in the fountain, and yet there is no
chance that he changes into a daffodil. He can call himself
every pretty name in the nurse’s vocabulary, and yet
no one will ever accuse him of flattering his own person.
He may fondle and hug himself till his miniature counterpart
loses both breath and patience; he may expend upon
his little self a thousand compliments and praises; and yet
it will never be insinuated that Mr —— is on uncommonly
good terms with Mr ——. This, it must be remarked, is
one of the compensations allowed by Providence for the
anxiety and pains attendant upon the keeping of a child.</p>

<p>It is a very common impression among those who are
practically unacquainted with children, that there is an immense
deal of trouble incurred in their management. There
is, no doubt, much trouble, but there is also much to alleviate
it. Women, to whom, as mothers or as nurses,
this trouble chiefly falls, are rarely heard to complain of
it. The labour is either kindly and agreeable in itself, or
it is rewarded by the generous pleasure of knowing that
those are helped who cannot help themselves. There are
few duties, it may be said, by which women appear to
feel less oppressed, than the labour of managing children.
What is very strange, it seems equally lightsome to the
hired attendant as to the mother herself. There appears
to be a general feeling among women that the neglect of,
or the least cruelty, to a child, is the most monstrous offence
in nature: it is the high treason of the sex. In the
more refined circles of society, where it is convenient to
employ deputies, this certain kindness of every female heart
towards a child is very fortunate: in the lower circles it is
still more so. <em>There</em> many mothers are compelled to depend
much upon the good-will of neighbours for the attentions
necessary to their families. The infant is, indeed, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
some measure the protegé of a little vicinity, rather than
of any individual. It is handed about from one hand to
another, and kept for a little by each, so as to enable the
mother to attend to other duties that are still more indispensable—such
as the preparation of her family meals, or,
perhaps, the work necessary for obtaining them. There
is in this no danger for the child, and not much obligation
for the parents. The poor are in the constant practice of
performing acts of kindness to each other: they are their
own best friends; and their condition would be quite insupportable
if it were otherwise. The attentions, therefore,
which one neighbour bestows upon another’s child,
are felt as a very slight burden by the particular party
obliging, while the aggregate of many such little favours
forms an immense relief to the mother. Then, every one
knows that if the case were her own, as it perhaps may be,
the individual whom she now obliges would be ready and
glad to oblige her in turn. If the trouble of managing
children had in it any thing really disagreeable, this universal
system of mutual serviceableness could never obtain
among the poor.</p>

<p>It is surprising how much children tend to humanise
and soften the stern scene of general life. The man who
is so fortunate as to possess one or more children, finds it
less easy to be wicked than if he had none; and, however
evilly disposed any man may be, he will hardly give way
to his wicked tendencies in the presence of his children.
There is something holy in a child. Its innocence puts
it in association with all gentle and devout feelings; and
scarcely any parent will venture deliberately to contaminate
the bright image of heavenly purity, which the Father
of heaven has himself placed under his charge. Even the
infidel can never form the wish that his child should be the
same; he may dare many things, upon the peril of his own
soul, but he cannot dare to hazard the soul of his child.
His own mind may be torn by the demons of doubt and
error, but he will keep his child steadfast if he can, melting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
nightly at the infantine prayer, which he cannot offer
up himself. If a parent has been imprudent, and now
suffers the bitter effects of his folly, in misfortunes which
have exposed him to the contempt of mankind, here still
is a resource. He can steal by night to the couch of his
children, and, beside the unconscious babes, whose fate
hangs all upon his, and who yet reprove not, in their silent
innocence, the guilt which has exposed them to misery,
weep himself into good resolutions, and into comfort.</p>

<p>One of the chief sources of a parent’s pleasure in contemplating
children, lies in the prospects which it is impossible
to avoid forming regarding their future lives. No
parent ever contemplates an unhappy fate for his child:
all the look-forward is sunny as its own sweet eyes—stainless
as its uncorrupted heart. There is even hardly any
parent who rests content with hoping that his children will
be as fortunate and as happy as himself. They must be
much more so: they must reach heights of distinction far
above any he had ever presumed to expect for himself.
To the parent who has occasion to lament his unhappy
circumstances in life, what treasured consolation there is
in these fond imaginings! The father, as he broods moodily
over enterprises blighted, and a spirit confined for immediate
bread to some narrow scene of action unworthy of
its energies—one casual glance alights upon the fair brow
of his child, the bitter present gives way to the glorious
future, and all his own griefs are repaid by the prospective
happiness of his offspring. The mother who looks back
to the comforts of an early home, unhappily exchanged for
a scene of care and woe, feels, as she bends over her unconscious
infant, her former happiness arise in the prospects
of that endeared being, and is for the time consoled.
It is this habit of forming flattering anticipations respecting
the fates of our children, that renders the loss of them in
infancy so very severe a calamity. In reality, the life of
a child is of little value: it has as yet cost little, either in
care or expense; and, unless in particular circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
it holds but an unimportant place in society. Yet it is in
this very want of all probation of its value that the poignancy
of the loss chiefly lies. We lament it, not at all for
what it was at the time of its death, but for what it might
have been, if it had been spared. We often find that the
loss of an infant is lamented with a more violent and unappeasable
grief than that of an adult; and this is simply
because, in the one case, the damage is ascertained, and
forms but one distinct idea; while in the other it is arbitrary,
vast, beyond imagination. A child is, in one sense,
a dangerous possession: it is apt to warp itself into the
vitals of our very soul; so that, when God rends it away,
the whole mental fabric is shattered. It should always,
then, be borne in mind, that life is the more uncertain the
nearer its commencement, and that the beings we are disposed
to appreciate most are just those whom we are most
apt to lose.</p>

<p>The feelings of a parent, regarding a child in dangerous
sickness, are beautifully expressed in the following poem,
which will surprise many readers into tears:—<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">When a scene like this is closed by death, what an extinction
of hopes! No parent, it may be remarked, ever
thinks he can <em>spare a child</em>. Whatever be the number of
his family, he is almost sure to be afflicted to exactly a
certain degree by the loss of any individual infant; for
simply this reason, that every one has established its own
claim to his affections, by some peculiar trait of its appearance
or character. It is a lovely and admirable trait of
human nature, that the parent is rather apt to appreciate
the lost child above all the rest. The impossibility of a
realization of his hopes regarding that infant, just makes
all those hopes the brighter, so that the twilight of the
child’s <em>dead existence</em> is more splendid than the broad day
of its living life. The surviving babes are all more or less
connected with the common-place of this world—the homeliness
of nature; but that fair-haired innocent, which went
to its place in the blush and dawn of its faculties, what
might it not have been? Then, the stirring grief of parting
with that face that was our own—that more than
friend, though but an infant—to break off all the delightful
ties of prattling tenderness, that had bound us, even in a
few months, to that gentle form for ever! A sorrow like
this is long in being altogether quenched; it comes in soft
gushes into the heart for many future years, and subdues
us in the midst of stronger and sterner feelings. The image
lives always before us in unchanging infancy, and beauty,
and innocence; it ever seems to be walking in our eyes,
as of yore, with its bright curling hair, and its lightsome
carol; and we long for heaven, that we may enjoy that no
small portion of its pleasures—a restoration to the company
of that mortal angel which has been reft away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TEA-DRINKING">TEA-DRINKING.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">There is a certain class of people who take every opportunity
of sneering at their neighbours for indulging in the
“folly” of drinking tea, which they tell you is poisonous,
and for the use of which the Chinese, as they say, make a
point of laughing at us. I have generally remarked, that
those who in this manner condemn the use of tea are
themselves addicted to the drinking of intoxicating liquids
of some kind or other, and that, in most instances, they
are not a bit more healthful or more innocent than the unhappy
tea-drinkers whom they affect to pity. In the way
that tea is usually made, with a large mixture of sugar and
cream, both which ingredients are highly nutritious, it is
fully more salutary, and a great deal more refreshing, than
any other light liquid that could be poured into the stomach.
With all due deference to Cobbett, milk, even entirely divested
of its creamy particles, is <em>heavy</em>; and though it may
be used with advantage as a meal, when work is done in
the open air, it can never suit the appetites of the great
mass of the people, who are confined by sedentary employments.
Milk is the food of men in a rude state, or in
childhood; but tea or well-made coffee is their beverage
in a state of civilisation. It would seem that the civilised
human being must use a large quantity of liquid food. Perhaps
solid meat is more nutritious; but there are cases in
which a small degree of nutriment is quite sufficient. A
lady or a gentleman of sedentary habits does not require to
feed like a ploughman, or a fancy man training for a pedestrian
excursion. They can subsist in a healthful state
with a small quantity of solid food, but they do not do well
unless with a large quantity of liquids, and these of a light
quality. Good beer has been recommended as a substitute
for tea; but beer is at the best a cold ungenial drink, except
to robust people who have much exercise. Beer may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
certainly be made almost as light as water itself, but in that
case it is filled with gaseous matter or confined air, and it
cannot be drunk with comfort as a simple refreshment.</p>

<p>It will always be remembered that there are different
kinds of tea, and that some are more salutary than others.
Green tea ought by all means to be avoided by persons of
weak nerves. Black tea is the preferable for general use,
and, if properly made, will prove anti-spasmodic, and relieve
pains or cramps in the bowels. In some instances
tea does not suit the particular state of the stomach, and
it should then be abandoned, the taste naturally pointing
out when it should be taken. But no species of prepared
fluid seems so suitable to the palates and the stomachs of
the people of this country. No kind of drink is so refreshing
after a journey or fatigue as tea. It restores the
drooping spirits, and invigorates the frame for renewed
exertion. No other kind of liquid with which we are
acquainted has the same remarkable influence morally and
physically. Fermented or distilled liquors, taken under
the same circumstances, either induce intoxication or sleep.
It is preposterous to say that tea is poisonous. As there
is an astringency in its properties, I believe it would be
most injurious were we to live upon nothing else, or drink
it as a tincture. But who does either? As it happens to
be prepared and used, it answers merely as a refreshing
and pleasing drink, either to the solid bread and butter
taken along with it, or after a recent dinner of substantial
viands. How idle it is to say that this harmless beverage
is ruining the constitutions of the people of this country!
The very reverse can be demonstrated. The inhabitants
of Britain use nearly twenty-seven millions of pounds
weight of tea annually, which is about one pound nine
ounces on an average for every individual. From thirty
to forty years ago they used a great deal less than the half
of this quantity, yet the average length of human life has
been greatly extended since that period. The English
and Scotch now use more tea than all the rest of Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
put together, and yet they are the healthiest nation on the
face of the earth. The North Americans are also great
tea-drinkers, and human life among them is of nearly an
equal value. Who would for a moment compare the thin
wretched wines of France and Germany, or the sour krout
of Russia, to the “comfortable” tea of Great Britain,
and who would lose time in calculating the different effects
of these liquids on the constitution?</p>

<p>Tea has other excellent properties. At this present
moment it is putting down the pernicious practice of dram-drinking,
and evidently limiting the extent of after-dinner
potations. It seems to be impossible that a regular drinker
of tea can be a lover of ardent spirits; and it is generally
observed, that, as a man (or woman either) slides into the
vice of tippling, he simultaneously withdraws from the tea-table;
so true it is that the brutalised feelings of the
drunkard are incompatible with the refined sentiments
produced by</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The cup which cheers, but not inebriates.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is hence to be wished that tea, or some other equally
simple prepared fluid, should be still more brought into
use. Do not let it be urged as an objection, that tea is
expensive; for even under its excessive dearth, compared
with its original cost, it is the cheapest beverage in use.
With respect to price, it should not be placed against water
or milk. It comes in place of some other indulgence—intoxicating
liquors for instance—respecting the price of
which we never heard any complaints from the lower
walks of life. Tea is thus not entirely a superfluity. The
clamours as to its fostering habits of evil and light speaking,
are so antiquated as hardly to deserve notice. Formerly,
when tea was exclusively a luxury among women,
the tea-table was perhaps the scene where scandal was
chiefly discussed. But while I suspect that the same
amount of scandal would have been discussed if there had
been no tea-tables whatever, I must observe, that tea is
now partaken of under greatly different circumstances.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
From being the favourite indulgence only of women, it is
now an ordinary domestic meal, and there is no more disposition
to draw forth the failings of our neighbours over
tea than over roast beef or punch, at seven o’clock any
more than at five. In the upper classes of society, what
with late dinners, routs, and frivolities of every description,
tea-drinking may be put aside as a vulgarism; but as being,
in point of fact, a powerful agent in humanising the
harsh feelings of our nature, and cultivating the domestic
affections, I trust it will long hold a place in the dietetics
of the respectable middle and lower classes of Great Britain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HUSBANDS_AND_WIVES">HUSBANDS AND WIVES.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">We meet with numerous rules for the conduct of young
newly-married women of all ranks; and if the world is
not filled with good wives, it certainly is not because there
is any want of matronly counsel for their guidance. But
though the happiness of the conjugal state depends at
least as much upon the behaviour of the husband as on
that of the wife, there has not, as far as we are aware,
been hitherto promulgated any code of instructions for the
use of the former. Our literature abounds with narrations
which exhibit the dutifulness and affection of women to
husbands unworthy of them, who repaid tenderness with
brutality, nor relented till those whose every amiable feeling
they ought to have cherished and rewarded with their
love, either sank broken-hearted, or, grown desperate, became
even more abandoned and profligate than themselves.
The man is to blame in nine cases out of ten
where an alliance proves unhappy. In the lower ranks,
especially, it is too often a want of prudence on his part
that renders so many families wretched. <em>Of the multitudes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
of those who have wasted character, health, and means, in intemperance,
there is but a small proportion who might not
have preserved respectability by listening to the admonitions
of their wives.</em> Yet, with these numerous and undeniable
facts before the world, no writer thinks of preventing such
evils by pointing out and enforcing the duties of the party
from whose misconduct they chiefly spring. A small portion
of our columns, therefore, will not be unprofitably bestowed
on a subject of so much importance.</p>

<p>In order to secure the felicity of the married state, a
husband must, in the first place, endeavour to secure the
perfect confidence of his wife. He must banish every
thing repulsive from his manner towards her, and live with
her on such easy and friendly terms that she may never
be discouraged from communicating with and consulting
him on every affair, whether it be in the lesser or the greater
concerns of life. If a wife do not find at home sympathy
with her afflictions, cares, and anxieties, she will seek it
abroad—she will detail her griefs to some acquaintance, to
whom she will go for advice in matters of difficulty, and,
perhaps, in matters of delicacy, which cannot properly be
appreciated by a stranger, and therefore ought not to be
entrusted to the ear of one. The happiness of the family
will thus be made to depend in a great measure on a person
not a member of it, who, whatever be her prudence, is
not intimately interested in the preservation of its peace,
and who is more likely to take a side and encourage feelings
of animosity than to inculcate the duty of mutual forbearance.</p>

<p>The husband’s duty must therefore be to establish in
the mind of his partner an entire reliance on his affection,
and a thorough persuasion that he is disposed to the full
amount of his power to promote her comfort. Let him
not think it beneath him to take an interest in her domestic
arrangements: by showing that he does so, he will make
her sensible that her efforts to render home pleasing are
not unappreciated; her labour for that end will be redoubled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
and yet prove more light to her. As he must
be abroad the greater part of the day, let him not deprive
her of his company in the hours of leisure that business
leaves him. A man cannot altogether seclude himself from
the world in the bosom of his family; neither can he always
carry his wife along with him: but he must not for
a light reason allow himself to be detained from her society.
A woman’s hours are often lonely; and after she has bestowed
her whole cares for a day to set her house in order,
and anxiously awaits her husband’s return, in the hope of
enjoying a few hours of mutually endearing converse by
the cheerful hearth, if she have to watch every approaching
footstep in vain, it is a cruel disappointment. One of
the greatest sins which the husband can commit, is that of
making a practice of staying out late at night, which, though
not reckoned among the usual catalogue of crimes against
social life, is one of those most worthy of reprobation.
The mental anguish endured by many excellent wives from
this infamous practice, no one can picture unless he have
witnessed it. There, by the lonely hearth—the fire sunk
to a cinder and a mass of ashes—the candle verging to its
close in the socket—the dingy silent apartment strewed
with the toys and furniture of the children, sent hours
since to bed—there, in the midst of this domestic wilderness
sits the drooping, desponding, almost broken-hearted
wife, counting the hours, and conning over in her wearied
mind the numbers of times she has been so deserted, and
foreseeing the still greater misery which awaits her by such
a course of profligacy in her husband. And for what, may
we ask, has the master of the household thus deserted his
home?—the company of hollow friends, idle acquaintances,
perhaps drunkards or gamblers, whose witless jocularity
forms the temptation to abandon a good name, fortune,
worldly respectability, and self-esteem. None but the wife
who has endured trials of this nature can properly understand
the horrors resulting from such a life of folly and
dissipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>Every reader must be delighted with the beautiful excuse,
which, among others, Sir Thomas More makes why
he did not publish his Utopia sooner. It shows us how
important that great man considered an attentive performance
of the minor duties of life to be. “Seeing that
almost the whole of the day is devoted to business abroad,
and the remainder of my time to domestic duties, there is
none left for myself—that is, for my studies. For, on returning
home, I have to talk with my wife, prattle with
my children, and converse with my servants: all which
things I number among the duties of life; since, if a man
would not be a stranger in his own house, he must, by
every means in his power, strive to render himself agreeable
to those companions of his life whom nature has provided,
chance thrown in his way, or that he has himself
chosen.”</p>

<p>The husband must not accustom himself to form resolutions,
and, without previously consulting his wife, make
a sudden declaration of his purposes, in the same way as
he would casually mention to a neighbour a plan, the execution
of which he is just on the point of commencing.
Even although such resolutions may be come to in a spirit
of wisdom, to determine upon any measure without her
participation argues a want of confidence in her affection
and judgment, and cannot fail greatly to distress and discourage
her. Granting that there are some matters of
which the husband is the most competent judge, and that
his wife cannot aid or improve his schemes, still she ought
to be made acquainted with them, and the reasons for
them, as far as possible; for it is only proper that the wife
should be admitted to the satisfaction of knowing what is
expected to produce advantage to her husband. As to
what some write, that women are not fit to be entrusted
with great affairs, it may have been true in the cases which
gave occasion to the remark, where the object involved a
course of crooked policy, or where the ear to which the
secret was committed was that of a female from whom fidelity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
was scarcely in any case to be expected. If a man’s
designs be bad, the best way for success in them is to make
the disclosure to nobody—least of all to women; to whom,
if they be depraved, how can he trust? and if they be not
thoroughly hardened in wickedness, how much less can
he trust to them, seeing that, being of much tenderer consciences
than men, they are always more ready to relent!
But if he would make his way in the world by fair and honest
practices, a husband can have no better counsellor
than his wife: her stretch of understanding may not be so
masculine as to embrace the subject in all its more important
bearings, but, in the lesser details of management, her
advice may prove invaluable.</p>

<p>Without a constant and unreserved interchange of sentiments,
a constant and perfect cordiality cannot be maintained;
and then, indeed, when things are communicated
only by fits and starts, and perhaps never more than half
explained, leaving an impression that her discretion is distrusted,
the wife will be more apt to carry them abroad,
to endeavour, by the help of other wits than her own, to
penetrate what is concealed, and in the hope of finding, in
the sympathy of others, consolation for the want of confidence
with which she is treated at home. It is thus that
a man becomes by degrees “a stranger in his own house.”
His domestic behaviour is observed with the same distant
caution with which his conduct in public is scrutinised;
and as in all likelihood he does not take the same pains
to produce a favourable impression, and is not equally on
his guard to obviate misinterpretations of what he says and
does, he must appear proportionably less amiable; and as
the endearments of domestic life are in consequence withdrawn,
the bad effects of his unsocial humour are at last
felt in his own discomfort.</p>

<p>“Those that are curious observers of mankind,” says a
Christian philosopher, who is not so generally known as
might be expected from the excellence of his writings, “love
to consider them in the most familiar lights. When men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
are abroad, they choose to appear (whatever they really
are) to the best advantage; but at home, their minds, as
well as their persons, are in a perfect undress and dishabille.
The world is the great theatre on which they act
a part; but, behind the scenes, they may be seen in their
proper persons, without any studied appearances. Our
domestic behaviour is, therefore, the main test of our
virtue and good nature. In public, we may carry a fair
outside; our love may be not without dissimulation nor our
hatred without disguise; but at home, Nature, left to
itself, shows its true and genuine face, with an unreserved
openness, and all the soul stands forth to view,
without any veil thrown over it. There we see men
in all the little and minute circumstances of life, which,
however they may be overlooked by common observers,
yet give a man of discernment a truer opening into a man’s
real character, than the more glaring and important transactions
of it, because, as to these, they are more upon
their guard—they act with more of caution and of art than
of plain simple nature. In short, our good or ill breeding
is chiefly seen abroad, our good or ill nature at home. It
were to be wished that we had more family pieces preserved
and transmitted down to us. The good public
magistrate is of use to few only; but the prudent and affectionate
father of a family is of a more general and extensive
influence. For my part, I more admire Cornelius,
the centurion, for that short sketch of his character, viz.
that he was a devout man, and one that feared God, <em>with
all his house</em>, than if he had been represented as the most
victorious general that had enlarged the bounds of the
Roman empire; for we learn from it this useful lesson—that
the influence of a pious example, like the precious
ointment from Aaron’s beard, descends downwards from
the head of the family, diffuses itself over the main body,
till it reaches the very skirts—the lowest members of it.”</p>

</div>


<p class="no-indent">Before saying a word upon the subject, I must make an
apology similar to that presented by honest Andro Symson,
episcopal minister of a Galloway parish before the
Revolution, when, in singing the praises of Sir David
Dunbar of Baldoon, he says, his muse</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">——’gainst Priscian avers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>He</em>, <span class="allsmcap">HE ALONE</span>, <em>were my parishioners</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">As good Andro’s congregation of one required to be spoken
of in the plural, so do my friends <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> need to be
mentioned in the singular number. The truth is, <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> is
a collective ideality, a most potent plural unit, who does
a great many remarkable things in the world, without ever
being called to account for them, and without any body
knowing very distinctly who or what he is. I venture to
say, that hardly a subject of his Majesty does not, day by
day, refer events and deeds to the agency of <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>, and
yet never has presumed, to this blessed hour, to consider
who this mysterious personage—this great unknown—this
finer spirit than Ariel—can be. In very truth, he
is a most impalpable being, and susceptible of a wonderful
variety of shapes. There is no height of greatness, and
no depth of degradation, which he may not arrive at.
Sometimes one would suppose that he is the government
itself—sometimes, only a town council. One of <span class="allsmcap">THEY’S</span>
employments is the disposal of criminals. “Are <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>
going to hang this fellow?” one man will ask another.
“Perhaps <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> will only banish him,” is the probable
answer. If the culprit be not decently and humanely
hanged, the people get dreadfully enraged at <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>, and
look as if they would almost tear his eyes out. <span class="smcap">They</span> also
has a great deal to do in public works. “Why did <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>
make the road so crooked?” “<span class="smcap">They</span> have put up a very
absurd set of street lamps, I see.” “What, in wonder’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
name, do <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> mean by building a temple up there, like a
boy’s peerie, or an hour-glass?” Then <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> is the author
of all kinds of rumours and surmises. “They say—what
say they—let them say!” is an inscription on a wall within
Aberdeen Cathedral four hundred years old; and I do not
doubt that <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> would have given currency to scandals
regarding the mother of mankind herself, in Paradise, if
there had been any other lady to tell them to—or if
<span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> had then existed. Old newspapers say, “<span class="smcap">They</span>
write from St Petersburg that the Empress Catharine is
about to fit out an armament for the Caspian.” “<span class="smcap">They</span>
talk at Rome of a change of councils in the Vatican.”
Modern quidnuncs are also filled to the brim with things
which <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> has been circulating. “<span class="smcap">They</span> are now making
out Lord —— to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non compos</i>.” “<span class="smcap">They</span> will have a
marriage to be on the tapis between <span class="smcap">So-and-So</span> and <span class="smcap">So-and-So</span>;”
personages, by the way, who claim a sort of
kindred with <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>, and certainly are of imagination all
compact. <span class="smcap">They</span> is sometimes admired for his power,
sometimes blamed for his stinginess. “<span class="smcap">They</span> used to write
capital solid books long ago.” “<span class="smcap">They</span> used Burns very
ill when he was alive.” It certainly was bad of <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> to
treat Burns so scurvily; but unfortunately the fellow is so
utterly impersonal, that we blame without knowing what
we are doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> has a great deal to do with the <em>naming</em> of things.
He may be called, in arithmetical language, the <em>Grand
Denominator</em>. Indeed, I do not believe that Adam himself
named more things than <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>. “What do <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>
call this place?” one will ask a coachman, on nearing a
town, village, or gentleman’s seat. “<span class="smcap">They</span> call it Ashbourne,”
or whatever else, is the reply. “What do <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>
call ye?” is the ordinary question of a rustic boy to his
unknown companion, and so forth. <span class="smcap">They</span> is also the
grand censor of all things which happen in the world.
“I will not do this, for what would <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> say of me?” is
a common expression, when a man hesitates upon some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
equivocal step. He may be convinced, from irrefragable
data, of the propriety of what he contemplates: but then
he could not convince <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> of it, and, of course, in these
circumstances, he must let the scheme drop. <span class="smcap">They</span> thus
prevents many things that would be bad, many things that
would be only strange, and many things that would certainly
be good, if he could be convinced of it. A most
uncompromising fellow is this <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>! He knows very
well that he cannot enter into another man’s bosom, to see
all the various reasons and tendencies which lead him towards
the thing he aims at; but, nevertheless, presuming
that he is quite omniscient, or at least fully as well acquainted
with every other particular man’s business as his own,
he never hesitates to give a decided contradiction to any
proposal he is not, at first sight, pleased with. Many are
the good original schemes which <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> has spoilt, from a
hasty conclusion without premises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span>, also, amidst all his multitudinous and most Protean
varieties of character, is a general scapegoat for all
the mischief that is done in a household. “I see <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>
have cracked that decanter.” “<span class="smcap">They</span> have at last made an
end of the globe in the lobby.” Or, as I once heard said
by the lady of a house afflicted with a breaking woman-servant,
“I declare <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> have broken the very kitchen
poker!”—a compound fracture, too, it was. Such are a
few of the doings of <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> in his household capacity; and
it must be owned that in this light he is very great, and
often comes above-board. The grandest aspect, however,
in which <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> ever appears, is when he stands up as a
representative of the government of the country. “<span class="smcap">They</span>
are going, I see, to bring us into a war with France.”
“<span class="smcap">They</span> intend, it seems, to resume cash payments at the
Bank.” No matter whether the affair refers to privilege
or prerogative; no matter for the claims of the particular
officer under whose hands it ought to fall; King, Lords,
Commons, Treasury, Admiralty, and Horse Guards—all
melt, like mixed colours, into the single white light of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>! Things may be different under the Reform Bill;
but, heretofore, there has hardly been any precise government
but <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>. <span class="smcap">They</span> crowns the king—signs the orders
of council—passes all bills through the legislature that
<em>will</em> go through—fits out armies, and rigs fleets—makes
war, and concludes peace—is church and state—Swing and
the Press. <span class="smcap">They</span> is a being of past history, and of present
existence—a tyrant, or the people. <span class="smcap">They</span> is the great
despot pronoun of the <em>world</em>!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="RELATIONS">RELATIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Owing to the different merits of the different members of
a family, and in some measure, also, to the various chances
which are vouchsafed to them of bettering their circumstances,
we generally see that, though they all begin alike,
some go <em>up</em> and some go <em>down</em> in life, so that in the long-run
the family, or at least its second generation, is scattered
over nearly the whole surface of society, from its top
to its bottom. The case may seem startling; but it is our
belief that there is hardly any person, be his own situation
ever so exalted, who has not relations, and near relations
too, in the very lowest walks of life—not only in the condition
of servants, perhaps, for that is decent, and, in its
way, respectable, but in the most degraded state to which
human nature can well be reduced.</p>

<p>In the same way, almost all of us have kinsfolk a little
higher in the scale than ourselves, or whom we think so—it
is all one. Now, it is quite amazing how accurate our
genealogical knowledge becomes respecting one of these
individuals, compared with its equally surprising ignorance
regarding those who have not been so fortunate. When
a cousin or half grand-uncle rises above our level, he rises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
into a blaze of light, which enables us to trace our connection
with him as plainly as we run our eye along the string
of a boy’s kite. But when a poor nephew or grand-nephew
descends into poverty and contempt, he seems
like a plummet submersed in the ocean, where, though we
may occasionally feel him tugging at the bottom of the line,
we are totally unable to trace the line itself. We are always
most laudably ready to exchange the civilities of life
and the affections of kindred with the cousin who has, in
the first place, convinced us of his merit by thatching himself
well over with bank-notes. It is pleasant to go and
dine at a kinsman’s house, where we know that our entertainment
can be furnished without any distress to our
worthy host. But really it is a totally different case to intrude
upon a scene where our poor friend is doing his best,
with the tears in his eyes, to satisfy the cravings of his
family with, perhaps, a very homely meal. Humanity in
that case demands that we should rather stay away, for we
know he does not like to be seen in his poor state. And
then, too, how easily we can put up with the eccentricities
of a wealthy relation, even though they may sometimes gall
our pride a little: how strangely liable, on the other hand,
are we to fall out with the poor unfortunates below us!
On the day after having been regaled to the uttermost excess
by our wealthy friend, we will quarrel with the poor
one for having drunk a single glass of some plebeian fluid.
With the former, nothing—with the latter, every thing, is
a fault. The imperfections of the poor are yawning and
palpable as their own rags: those of the rich are as smooth
as broad-cloth can make them. The truth is, our senses
can tolerate almost any odious or improper thing that is
found in a scene above our usual grade in the world. We
never know enough of it to be able to measure its real
odiousness, or it is disguised by the cordial appliances
which we always have ready for the sores of the great.
But the vices, nay, the smallest foibles of the lowly, come
before our senses so bare, so beggarly, so unanealed, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
moreover, they are so immediately followed by that additional
wretchedness which wealthy error escapes, that we
have no excuse for them. Hence we generally find, that
we have shaken off the most of our poor relations on account
of some trivial cause of offence, which we find it
necessary, however, to be always nursing in our minds, in
order to sustain us in the conviction that the breach of
treaty—the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus fœderis</i>—was sufficient.</p>

<p>There is one very obvious mark of the individual who
despises poor relations—a perpetual reference to rich ones.
Some people are constantly bringing in allusions to “my
cousin Mr This,” and “my uncle Mr That,” and even to
more remote relations, such as “my great-grandmother
the Countess of Somewhere.” A few are so very silly as to
tell, in the newspaper announcement of their marriage, that
their bride, besides being daughter to this or that plain
esquire, is “grand-niece to General So-and-So,” or “cousin
to Mr Such-a-Thing, secretary of state.” These announcements
are an impertinence fit for the interference of
the legislature—or the police. If people have exalted
relations, let them enjoy them as much as they can within
themselves, but do not let them be perpetually presenting
this odious little piece of vanity before others, who not
only are not interested in it, but are perhaps reminded by
it that they have no fine relations themselves. To be always
thus singling out a relation from all the rest, and
holding him up in connection with ourselves, is a direct
injury to him, in so far as we are thus trying to exalt ourselves
at his expense—an indirect insult to our kindred in
general, whom we leave out of view, and a nuisance to all
before whom we thus exhibit our own poverty of soul. It
is a <em>cultivation</em> of the most odious character, and necessarily
suggests to every thinking person, that in exact proportion
to our homage to the great persons of our family must be
our haughtiness and severity to the humble. The people
addicted to this vice of conversation are evidently satisfied
in their own minds that they are talking very fine, and exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
no feeling in their hearers but admiration and respect;
but in reality they are always scouted and ridiculed, even
to the degree of being honoured with a nickname, carved,
perhaps, out of the favourite phrase.</p>

<p>A really good and philosophical spirit will neither plume
himself upon his more fortunate, nor despise his less fortunate,
relations. He will modestly rejoice in the success
of the former, and take care, by avoiding the appearance
of intrusiveness on the one hand, and splenetic and
pettish jealousy on the other, to afford no reason for
the fortunate individual to feel incommoded by the connection,
and, consequently, to endeavour to shake it off.
To those who are less fortunate than himself, he will be
as encouraging and kind as his circumstances render prudent
or decent, neither manifesting that vulgar pride which
tries needlessly to make a kind of virtue out of a low origin,
nor that still more pitiable vanity which denies all inferior
kindred, and seeks, at the expense of real dignity, the eclat
of a few “great friends.” We allow there is a general
difficulty in the case. Friends in different worldly circumstances
are like positive and negative clouds in electricity:
there is a constant tendency in the poor to an equalization,
which is not relished by the parties whose pockets are
charged positively. But human nature should be always
contending with its weaknesses, and, though full confiding
friendship is not perhaps to be expected, there may still
be a sufficient interchange of kindness to lighten, in no small
degree, the general burden of life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STRANGERS_NOOK">THE STRANGERS’ NOOK.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">In country churchyards in Scotland, and perhaps in other
countries also, there is always a corner near the gateway,
which is devoted to the reception of strangers, and is distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
from the rest of the area by its total want of
monuments. When you inquire of the passing peasant
respecting this part of the burial-ground, he tells you that
it is the corner for strangers, but never, of course, thinks
that there is or can be any sentiment in the matter. To
me, I must confess, this spot is always more interesting
than any other, on account of the more extended scope
which it gives to those feelings with which one surveys a
churchyard. As you wander over the rest of the ground,
you see humble memorials of humbler worth, mixed perhaps
with the monuments of rank and wealth. But these
tell always a definite tale. It is either the lord or the
tenant of some of the neighbouring fields, or a trading
burgher, or perhaps a clergyman; and there is an end of
it. These men performed their parts on earth, like the
generality of their fellows, and, after figuring for a space on
the limited arena of the parish or the district, were here
gathered to their fathers. But the graves of the strangers!
what tales are told by every undistinguished heap—what
eloquence in this utter absence of epitaphs!</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the individuals who rest in
this nook belonged, with hardly the possibility of an exception,
to the humbler orders of the community. But who
will say that the final sufferings and death of any individual
whatsoever are without their pathos? To me, who have
never been able to despise any fellow-creature upon general
considerations, the silent expressive stories related
by these little heaps, possess an interest above all real eloquence.
Here, we may suppose, rests the weary old man,
to whom, after many bitter shifts, all bitterly disappointed,
wandering and mendicancy had become a last trade. His
snow-white head, which had suffered the inclemency of
many winters, was here at last laid low for ever. Here
also the homeless youth, who had trusted himself to the
wide world in search of fortune, was arrested in his wanderings;
and, whether his heart was as light and buoyant
as his purse, or weighed down with many privations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
disappointments, the end was the same—only in the one
case a blight, in the other a bliss. The prodigal, who
had wandered far, and fared still worse and worse, at
length returning, was here cut short in his better purpose,
far from those friends to whom he looked forward as a
consolation for all his wretchedness. Perhaps, when
stretched in mortal sickness in a homely lodging in the
neighbouring village, where, though kindness was rendered,
it was still the kindness of strangers, his mind wandered
in repentant fondness to that mother whom he
had parted with in scorn, but for whose hand to present
his cup, and whose eye to melt him with its tenderness,
he would now gladly give the miserable remains of his
life. Perhaps he thought of a brother, also parted with
in rage and distrust, but who, in their early years, had
played with him, a fond and innocent child, over the summer
leas, and to whom that recollection forgave every
thing. No one of these friends to soothe the last moments
of his wayward and unhappy life—scarcely even to
hear of his death when it had taken place. Far from
every remembered scene, every remembered face, he was
doomed here to take his place amidst the noteless dead,
and be as if he had never been. Perhaps one of these
graves contains the shipwrecked mariner, hither transferred
from the neighbouring beach. A cry was heard by night
through the storm which dashed the waves upon the rocky
coast; deliverance was impossible; and next morning, the
only memorial of what had taken place was the lifeless
body of a sailor stretched on the sand. No trace of name
or kin, not even the name of the vessel, was learned; but,
no doubt, as the villagers would remark in conveying him
to the Strangers’ Nook, he left <em>some</em> heart to pine for his
absence, <em>some</em> eyes to mourn for him, if his loss should
ever be ascertained. There are few so desolate on earth
as not to have one friend or associate. There must either
be a wife to be widowed, or a child to be made an orphan,
or a mother to suffer her own not less grievous bereavement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
Perhaps the sole beloved object of some humble
domestic circle, whose incomings and outgoings were ever
pleasant, is here laid low, while neither can the bereaved
learn aught of the fate and final resting-place of their favourite,
nor can those who kindly, but without mourning,
performed his last offices, reach their ears with the intelligence,
grateful even in its pain, of what had been done to
his remains; here the energies which had battled with the
waves in their hour of night, and the despair whose expression
had been wasted upon the black tempest, are all stilled
into rest, and forgotten. The storm is done; its work
has been accomplished; and here lies the strange mariner,
where no storms shall ever again trouble him.</p>

<p>Such are the imaginings which may arise in contemplating
that neglected nook in our churchyards which is devoted
to the reception of strangers. The other dead have all
been laid down in their final beds by long trains of sorrowing
friends. They rest in death in the midst of those beloved
scenes which their infancy knew, and which were
associated with every happiness, every triumph, every sorrow,
which befel them. The burns in which they had
“paidlet” when they were children, run still in their shining
beauty all around and about their last resting-place;
the braes over which they wandered hand in hand, “to
pu’ the gowans fine,” still look down in all their summer
pride upon the fold into which they have at last been gathered
for eternity. But the homeless strangers! <em>they</em>
died far from every endeared scene. The rills were not
here like those which <em>they</em> had known; the hills were different
too. Instead of the circle of friends, whose anticipated
grief tends so much to smooth the last bed of suffering
man, the pillow of the homeless was arranged by strangers:
they were carried to the burial-ground, not by a train of
real mourners, anxious to express their respect and affection
for the departed, but by a few individuals, who, in so
doing, complimented human nature in general, but not the
individual. To the other graves there was also some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
to resort afterwards, to lament the departure of those who
lay below. The spot was always cherished and marked
by at least one generation of kind ones; and, whether distinguished
by a monument or not, it was always a greater
or less space of time before the memory of the deceased
entirely perished from its place. Still, as each holy day
came round, and the living flocked to the house of prayer,
there was always some one to send a kind eye aside towards
that little mound, and be for a moment moved with
a pensive feeling, as the heart recalled a departed parent,
or child, or friend. But the graves of the strangers! all
regard was shut out from them as soon as they were closed.
The decent few who had affected mourning over them had
no sooner turned away than they were at once forgotten.
That ceremony over, their kind had done with them for
ever. And so, there they lie, distinguished from the rest
only by the melancholy mark that they are themselves undistinguished
from each other; no eye to weep over them
now or hereafter, and no regard whatsoever to be paid to
them till they stand forth, with their fellow-men, at the
Great and Final Day.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Except on particular grounds of demerit. This is a
maxim which it would be well if the world would pay more
attention to.</p>

<p>There are many people—very good people, too—who
have a habit of speaking contemptuously or lightly of almost
every body but themselves. There are still more
who do not seem to consider it necessary to treat the absent
with the least respect, but, to use the words of a
modern writer, are remarkably candid in owning and showing
up the faults of their neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>These, I think, are detestable practices of human nature—the
issue of its weakness rather than its strength.</p>

<p>When I think of a great and good character, I cannot
conceive that he has a habit of depreciating the respect
due to his absent friends, or of treating any of his fellow-creatures
with scorn, unless for some specific delinquency.
Such a person will be already too secure of his own reputation
to seek to raise it at the expense of others. He
will be able to take an enlarged view of human society,
and, seeing that the condition of all men is in a great
measure accidental, or at least moulded greatly by circumstances,
will not despise any man on account of his
mere place in the general system, but, on the contrary,
give him respect in proportion to his good conduct in that
place, whatever it may be. Such a man, also, will have
too much respect for himself, to use language at any time
which he would be ashamed to own at another time. He
would not indulge in a tone of levity or rancour respecting
any man, on whose entrance accidentally into the room
he would have to alter his style, and hypocritically offer
him the usual courtesies of society.</p>

<p>It happens, however, that all men are more or less remote
from the greatness and goodness of this ideal character.
We are, as yet, only in a state of comparative
approximation to those qualities; hence we find that nearly
all are alike given to speak slightingly of each other. There
are two grand causes at the bottom of this—Selfishness
and Thoughtlessness. The former gives us such an intense
appreciation of ourselves, and of the rank we hold in
society, that we speak and think as if every man and every
class beneath us were too mean to be entitled to the least
respect; we look upon the whole as a degraded caste,
whose very existence must only be acknowledged indirectly,
as a thing we have become acquainted with by seeing it at
a distance, not by having ever come in contact with it. In
this view of society our ordinary literature is very apt to
confirm us. The key-note is there struck always in <em>alt.</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
The whole strain of the work, its characters, its philosophy,
its manners, are presumed to be something above
the common level; for literary men are still, after all, very
much the slaves of the great which they used to be. If
the writer describes humble life at all, he describes it as
seen by a bird’s-eye view from some lofty station—not as
seen by a person who mingles in it, and partakes of its
sympathies. Even the middle ranks of the community,
who in this country form the great mass of readers, and
from which, moreover, almost all literary men arise, have
no literature of their own: they have to read a literature
which has been calculated for the sphere above them, and
in which, of course, their sympathies must be of an imperfect
character. And thus, after all that has been done,
it still appears a desideratum that there should be both a
literature and a philosophy <em>for the human race</em>.</p>

<p>Then, as to <em>thoughtlessness</em>, as a cause for this universally
mutual contempt. It must be admitted, I should
think, that if we only took a proper consideration of the
noble destiny which all partake in common with ourselves,
both in respect to the grand moral ends of this life, and
the more sublime prospects for the future, we would hardly
think meanly of any one, except, as before mentioned, on
account of some specific worthlessness. For my part, I
wonder how any man can <em>dare</em> to despise a fellow-creature
upon other grounds. Is it difference of tongue, of rank,
of personal character, of external manners, that makes you
despise any one? What, I would ask, are all these distinctions
to the great fellowship of our common humanity—the
social end which we are working to as parts of a
great community—as parts of a glorious world, or the general
destiny which awaits us at the close of this brief
life? Reflect upon these things before you permit yourself
to think lightly of a fellow-creature; or, if these things are
of no avail with you, consider what you are yourself, that you
thus scorn another. I must say that I have often observed
the most contemptible man to be the most contemptuous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
There are some men who hardly make any other pretension
to the respect of the world, than in so far as they
profess to treat <em>every thing</em> cavalierly. But as he who
sheds blood must submit to have his blood shed by others,
so are these men at length detected, and tossed, as they
deserve, in a blanket of their own weaving. Individuals
may be assured that it is not by proclaiming a war of contempt
against the world, or any large number of its members,
that a comfortable situation is to be gained for
themselves.</p>

<p>There is a good old national proverb, which tells us that
the king’s errand may come in the pedlar’s road—that is
to say, a very lofty man may occasionally have to take a
favour from one in humble life. This is no mere flattering
unction applied by the common people to themselves.
It breathes the very spirit of an enlarged and humane
philosophy. It tells us that all ranks of men are in reality
dependent upon each other, and that every one, filling its
proper place, is entitled to its proportion of regard from the
rest. Treating the expression in its more limited sense,
it instructs us that, in the prospect of our being occasionally
obliged to accept of favours from very mean hands, we
should never treat any person beneath us with disrespect—as,
otherwise, with what grace can we accept of such a
favour? On this point I take the liberty to relate a simple
anecdote, as told to me some years ago, in illustration of
the subject of this essay, by the individual chiefly concerned—the
wife of a shopkeeper in a country town in the
north of Scotland.</p>

<p>“In —— there lived a poor woman, named Peggy
Williamson, a kind of washerwoman, whom every body
looked upon as a wretched creature. This despised and
not very reputable person had a son, who on one occasion
was taken up by the town-officers for some trifling offence,
and would have been thrown into prison, if I had not
thought the case rather a hard one, and interceded with
the magistrate in his behalf. Peggy, with all her faults,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
was not ungrateful; she came to me, and said she never
would forget my kindness.</p>

<p>“A long time after this, in consequence of a particular
calamity, my husband’s affairs got into a very hopeless
state. I was attending the shop one bleak November day.
Few customers were coming in, or likely to come in, and
our prospects were gloomy and dull as the atmosphere itself.
I never, indeed, since we began business, saw a day
when things seemed less promising. The whole street—the
whole town—appeared deserted. All was desolate,
cold, and wintry; and with the dread of utter ruin impending
over us, you may suppose that our spirits were
not very good. Well, just while we were in this dolorous
state, in came my old friend Peggy Williamson, accompanied
by a country girl, who, she said, wanted to provide
herself with a number of our wares, being about to
be married. This person expended six or eight pounds
with us, and we could not help feeling it as a kind of godsend.
It was, however, the result of my having at one
time done a just, for I can hardly call it a kind, action, to a
person whom the most of people despised. Peggy, who was
not perhaps aware of the full extent to which we appreciated
her good offices, told me very modestly, as she left
the shop with her friend, that she was glad to have had it in
her power to recommend any body to us for goods, ‘as
she never could forget my kindness to Tam.’ I thus satisfied
myself, not only that an act of ordinary benevolence
is likely to produce its reward where it is least expected,
but that some good feeling may exist even in those characters,
whom on ordinary principles we may be most inclined
to despise.”</p>

<p>Let us judge, then, or at least let us always be inclined
to judge, with tenderness, both of persons and of things.
Let us not take our impressions of the characters of our
fellow-creatures from the little obvious fault or foible which
lies upon the surface, and affords, of course, the subject
of largest discourse to the superficial; but, dashing aside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the weeds which mantle the surface of the character, ascertain
the extent and sweetness of the clear water beneath.
It is of great importance to men, but especially to young
men, to acquire a power of judging correctly and definitely
of every thing. They must learn to estimate every thing
relatively, and not be prevented from allowing merit, even
where it exists in the smallest quantities, by its being mingled
with a larger proportion of less worthy qualities. We
often find one kind of merit denied, because it is not another.
A man of untutored genius is sneered at because
he wants learning. A learned man is termed a stupid
dunce or a pedant, because he wants genius. The writer
of an unpretending narrative is described by some of his
invidious fellows as no Hume, or Gibbon, or Robertson. An
industrious tradesman is ridiculed as a mere plodder; a farmer
is laughed at because he is only acquainted with country
affairs. Glasgow is condemned as deficient in the
refined professional and literary classes of inhabitants, who
reside in Edinburgh; and Edinburgh is scouted for its being
“not at all a place of business.” These are vicious
habits of thought and speech—if <em>thought</em> there can be in
what argues a total absence of every thing like reason.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="TRUST_TO_YOURSELF">TRUST TO YOURSELF.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">This is a glorious principle for the industrious and trading
classes of the community, and yet the philosophy of it is
not perhaps understood so well as it ought to be.</p>

<p>There is hardly any thing more common in the country
than to hear men spoken of who originally, or at some
period of their lives, were rich, but were ruined by “<em>security</em>”—that
is, by becoming bound to too great an extent
for the engagements of their neighbours. This must arise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
in a great measure from an imperfect understanding of the
question; and it therefore seems necessary that something
should be said in explanation of it.</p>

<p>I would be far from desiring to see men shut up their
hearts against each other, and each stand, in the panoply
of his own resolutions, determined against every friendly
appeal whatsoever. It is possible, however, to be not
altogether a churl, and yet to take care lest we be tempted
into an exertion of benevolence, dangerous to ourselves,
while it is of little advantage to our friends.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many ties which connect a man
with society, he nevertheless bears largely imprinted on
his forehead the original doom, that he must chiefly be
dependent on his own labour for subsistence. It is found
by all men of experience, that, in so far as one trusts to
his own exertions solely, he will be apt to flourish; and,
in so far as he leans and depends upon others, he will be
the reverse. Nothing can give so good a <em>general</em> assurance
of well-doing as the personal activity of the individual,
day by day exerted for his own interest. If a man,
on the contrary, suddenly finds, in the midst of such a
career, a prospect of some patronage which seems likely
to enrich him at once, or if he fails into the heritage of
some antiquated claims to property or title, which he
thinks it necessary to prosecute, it is ten to one that he
declines from that moment, and is finally ruined. The
only true way to make a happy progress through this
world, is to go on in a dogged, persevering pursuit of one
good object, neither turning to the right nor to the left,
making our business as much as possible our pleasure,
and not permitting ourselves to awake from our <em>dream of
activity</em>—not permitting ourselves to <em>think that we have
been active</em>—till we suddenly find ourselves at the goal of
our wishes, with fortune almost unconsciously within our
grasp.</p>

<p>Now, it is a most violent and unhappy disturbance of
this system, to be always poking about after large favours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
from friends, whether for the purpose of adding fuel to what
we think a good fire, or preserving a bad one from extinction.
All that is obtained in this way is obtained against
the very spirit of correct business, and is likely to be only
mischievous to both parties. In the first place, it is probable
that we shall not make such a good use of money got
thus in a slump, without being painfully and gradually
won, as of that which is the acquisition of our own daily
industry. Then, it is always a presumption against a man
that he should require such subsidies; and, accordingly,
his commercial reputation is apt to suffer from every request
he makes. Next, to consider the case in reference to the
friend from whom the demand is made, it is obviously a
most unfair thing, that, when men find it so necessary to
be cautious in adventuring money on unusual risks, even
for their own interest, and are, in such circumstances, so
strongly called upon to make themselves acquainted with
every circumstance of the case before venturing—when,
moreover, they only do so in the prospect of an unusual
profit—I say it is unfair, that, when they only adventure
money on their own account under these circumstances,
they should be called upon occasionally to adventure
it for the profit of a friend, without knowing any thing of
the likelihood of its turning out well, without being able to
take any of those expedients which they would use in their
own case for insuring its eventual re-appearance, without
the least chance of profit to compensate the risk—trusting
the whole, in fact, to the uncertain and hidden sea of another
man’s mind, when perhaps they would not trust it
upon their own, with a full knowledge of soundings, tide,
wind, and pilotage. Men may grant such favours, from
their dislike to express such a want of confidence in a friend
as a refusal is supposed to intimate. But this proceeds
upon the erroneous principle that the refusal indicates want
of confidence. In reality, it ought only to be held as indicating
a want of confidence in the particular line of use
upon which it is to be adventured. When the man <em>now</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
wanting the loan of money expresses himself as certain to
reproduce it at the proper time, he pledges too much of
his honour; for there cannot be a stronger proof of the unlikelihood
of his having money <em>then</em> than his wanting it <em>now</em>,
so that the uncertainty of the reproduction of the sum
could never be greater. The person from whom it is demanded
is entitled, therefore, to take care that the petitioner
is not deceiving both himself and the individual
whom he wishes to supply his necessities.</p>

<p>Humanity—kindred—friendship—have many claims;
and these will always be considered and answered by a man
of good feelings. All that is here contended for, is the inconsistency
of a system of large accommodations with just
business, as well as with the real interests of either of the
two parties concerned. Upon the whole, a man will not
only be obliging himself in the best manner, but he will
also be obliging society in a higher degree than he otherwise
could do, if he simply looks well after himself, so that
he never <em>requires</em> a favour. Let no man be unduly alarmed
at the outcry of “<em>selfishness</em>;” it is the only principle which
can ever become nearly general, and therefore the only one
which can be equal or impartial in its action. When this
cry is raised, let the petitioned party always take pains to
consider whether he in reality <em>is</em> the selfish person—whether
the odium of that bad feeling does not indeed rather
lie with the petitioner, who is content, for the purpose of
saving himself some present inconvenience, or otherwise
advantaging himself, to bring a portion of his friend’s substance
into hazard—for hazard, of course, there always is,
whenever money leaves the possession of its owner, and in
hardly any kind of adventure is it ever in greater peril than
when lent, or engaged for, in this manner, without the prospect
of a profit. It is, in a great measure, a mere error
arising from want of reflection, to suppose that there can
only be inhumanity on the part of the individual who refuses
to lend or become bound. Inhumanity, of course,
there may often be in such refusals; but is there to be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
sympathy, on the other hand, for the friend betrayed?
Are we only to have pity for the man who wants money—no
matter through what causes he wants it—in March,
and none for him who is called upon to undertake the risk
of having to pay it in June, to his grievous inconvenience?
Does pity only acknowledge the present tense, and not the
future? Is it so silly a passion that it only feels for the
present wants of an individual who goes a-borrowing, and
has no regard to the contingent sorrows of him who, without
fault of his own, but with every merit to the contrary,
is beguiled into a ruin he did not purchase, in the ineffectual
attempt, perhaps, to save one who, supposing him to
be personally as worthy, was at least the only person with
whom blame, if blame there be, can in such a case be said
to rest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Summary.</span>—Fortune is most easily and most certainly
to be won by your own unaided exertions. Therefore,
depend as little as possible upon prospects of advantages
from others, all of whom, you will find, have enough ado
with themselves. Be liberal, affable, and kind; but,
knowing that you cannot do more injury to society than
by greatly injuring yourself, exercise a just caution in giving
way to the solicitations of your friends. Never be too
ready to convince yourself that it is right to involve yourself
largely, in order to help any person into a particular
station in society; rather let him begin at the bottom, and
he will be all the better fitted for his place, when he reaches
it, by having fought his way up through the lower stages.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LEISURE">LEISURE.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The most fallacious ideas prevail respecting leisure. People
are always saying to themselves, “I would do this,
and I would do that, if I had leisure.” Now, there is no
condition in which the chance of doing any good is <em>less</em>
than in the condition of leisure. The man fully employed
<em>may</em> be able to gratify his good dispositions by improving
himself or his neighbours, or serving the public in some
useful way; but the man who has all his time to dispose
of as he pleases, has but a poor chance, indeed, of doing
so. To do increases the capacity of doing; and it is far
less difficult for a man who is in a habitual course of exertion
to exert himself a little more for an extra purpose,
than for the man who does little or nothing to put himself
into motion for the same end. This is owing to a principle
of our moral nature, which is called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertiæ</i>, literally,
the strength of inactivity, but which I will explain at once
to unlearned persons, by reminding them, that, to set a
common child’s hoop a-going in the first place, requires a
smarter stroke than to keep it in motion afterwards. There
is a reluctance in all things to be set a-going; but when that
is got over, then every thing goes sweetly enough. Just
so it is with the idle man. In losing the <em>habit</em>, he loses
the <em>power</em> of doing. But a man who is busy about some
regular employment for a proper length of time every day,
can very easily do something else during the remaining
hours; indeed, the recreation of the weary man is apt to
be busier than the perpetual leisure of the idle. As he
walks through the world, his hands hang unmuffled and
ready by his side, and he can sometimes do more by a single
touch in passing, than a vacant man is likely to do in a
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>All this is exemplified fully in the actual practice of life.
Who, I would ask, compose the class who perform most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
of the business of public charity? It is not those who are
highly endowed with wealth and leisure. It is not in general
those whom wealth has placed at ease, but the class
of well-employed traders and manufacturers, who, to appearance,
are entirely engrossed by their own concerns.
These men will snatch an occasional hour from their well-employed
lives—perhaps an hour that ought to be devoted
to relaxation—and do you more real work in that time
than an idle man would accomplish in the half of his
yaw-yaw existence. What is curious, if you place the
busy trader on the shelf, as no longer requiring to work for
his subsistence, he immediately loses the power of doing
these little superfluous acts of goodness. In getting out
of the way of all exertion, he becomes unable to do any
thing, even when he wishes it. On the same principle,
men never give a job to a lawyer or any body else, who is
not pretty well occupied. And this is from no irrational
homage to the name of the man, as is sometimes thought;
it is because the man who does much is most likely to do
more, and most likely to do it well.</p>

<p>Let no man, then, cry for leisure in order to do any thing.
Let him rather pray that he may never have leisure. If
he really wishes to do any good thing, he will always find
time for it, by properly arranging his other employments.
The person who thus addresses the public has acquired the
power of doing so, such as it is, not by having had a great
deal of time at his own disposal, but solely by ravishing the
inglorious hours which the most of men spend in unprofitable
and <em>unenjoyed</em> pleasures, and employing them in the
cultivation of his mind. There is an anecdote told of a
French author of distinction, who by regularly employing,
in a few jottings, the five minutes which his wife caused
him to wait every day while she dressed for dinner, at last
formed a book; certainly not the least meritorious of his
works. Hazlitt also remarks, that many men walk as much
idly upon Pall Mall in a few years, as would carry them
round the globe. In fact, it may be said that to ask for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
leisure or time to do any ordinary thing, is equivalent to a
confession that we are indifferent about doing it.</p>

<p>It is very fair that the busy man should be at ease at
last. It is often the object for which he works. Neither
can it be allowed that there is any absolute claim upon the
wealthy to exert themselves for the good of the community.
Wealth must be enjoyed as the possessor pleases, or it is
no longer wealth, and one of the objects of industry is
taken away. But it would be of vast importance—both
to the wealthy idle themselves and to the community—if
their tastes could oftener be directed to some beneficial employment
within the range of their abilities and influence.
It is a shame to those who are entirely at their own disposal,
that almost all the general good that is done in the
world is done by those who are already overworked. It
might rather be expected that the affluent, who have no
particular business of their own to attend to, should devote
themselves to the general good. This is the more
particularly to be expected, when we observe the worse
than trifles upon which idle opulence generally employs
itself. If actual vice be avoided, the most contemptible
frivolities and paltry amusements are sought after, for the
purpose of—disgraceful word!—<em>killing time</em>. Sometimes
we find the universal necessity of doing something, taking
a good direction, or one at least rather on goodness’ side.
The female part of the affluent world are often found to
be actively benevolent; and nothing can be more laudable.
But the ells of idle humanity, that every day walk the
street in vain, are beyond all mensuration. Now, I am
convinced that if these leisurely persons only once fell into
the way of employing themselves for some good end, they
would find themselves far more comfortable than they are
at present. They would suddenly feel the inspiration of a
worthy purpose of existence. They would feel the self-importance
of active exertion—the majesty of industry;
that lofty feeling which even the hard-working housewife
feels in increased proportion amidst the sloperies of a washing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Saturday, and which gives to the early riser his right
to taunt and look down upon all the recumbent part of
mankind. The <em>gentlemen</em> must think of it. They must
up and be doing. It is, I repeat, a disgrace to them, in
this universally busy scene, to let all the laurels of charity
and kindness be carried away by those who have enough
ado to obtain their own subsistence.</p>

</div>


<p class="no-indent">It is very certain that all men are not born to be Franklins;
and, likewise, that if any considerable number of
such persons were to arise, their utility and their distinction
would be diminished. There is a good old proverb,
however—“aim at a silk gown, and you may get a sleeve
of it;” which may be followed out, both to the advantage
of individuals and to the benefit of the community.</p>

<p>First, there is one great maxim that no youth should
ever want before his eyes, namely, that hardly any thing
is beyond the attainment of real merit. Let a man set up
almost any object before him on entering life, and, if his
ambition be of that genuine kind which springs from talent,
and is <em>not too much for his prudence</em>, there is a strong chance
in his favour that a keen and steady pursuit of the object
will make him triumph at last. It is very common, when
the proposal of a young man’s entry into life is discussed,
to hear complaints as to the pre-occupation of every field
of adventure by unemployed multitudes. There may occasionally
be some cause for this; but the general truth is
undeniable, that, in spite of every disadvantage, men are
rising daily to distinction in every profession—the broadest
shoulders, as usual, making their way best through the
crowd. It is the slothful and the fearful that generally
make such complaints; and they obviously do so in order
to assure themselves that they are not altogether wrong in
continuing to misspend their time. When we hear of the
overcrowded state of any proposed profession, we are apt
to overlook that an immense proportion of those engaged
in it are destined, by the weakness of their character, and
want of specific qualifications, to make no way for themselves,
and must soon be the same, so far as rivalry is concerned,
as if they had never entered it. If the entrant,
then, has only a well-grounded confidence in his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
powers of exertion and perseverance, he need hardly be
afraid to enter any profession. With the serious desire of
well-doing at heart, and some tolerable share of ability, he
is sure very soon to get ahead of a great proportion of those
already in the field. Only let him never despair—that is,
tell himself it is all in vain, in order that he may become
idle with a good conscience—and there is hardly any fear
of him.</p>

<p>The present writer entertains some different ideas respecting
original humility of circumstances from what are
generally prevalent. The common notion is, that humble
circumstances are a great obstruction at the outset of life,
and that the more difference between a man’s origin and
his eventual condition, the greater is the wonder, and the
greater his merit. Since it appears, however, that so large
a proportion of distinguished men were poor at the beginning,
a question may naturally arise, are not men just the
more apt, on that account, to become eminent? Although
we are all familiar as possible with instances of fortunes
made from nothing, it will be found, on recollection, that
cases are comparatively rare of men who began with fortunes
having ended by greatly increasing them. Many a
poor boy has made twenty thousand pounds before he was
forty years of age; but few who had ten thousand at the
age of majority are found to double it with their years.
Here—here is a reason for hope. The fact is, large sums
are not to be acquired without an appreciation and an
understanding of the meanest financial details. To make
pounds, we must know the value of shillings; we must
have felt before how much good could sometimes be done,
how much evil could sometimes be avoided, <em>by the possession
of a single penny</em>! For want of this knowledge, the
opulent youth squanders or otherwise loses more, perhaps,
than he gains. But he who has risen from the ranks knows
the value and powers of every sum, from the lowest upwards,
and, <em>as saving is the better part of the art of acquiring
money</em>, he never goes back a step—his whole march<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
is <span class="allsmcap">ONWARD</span>. At the very worst, it is only a question of
time. Say one man begins at twenty with a good capital,
and another at the same age with none. For want of
experience, and through other causes above mentioned,
it is not likely that the former person has made much
advance within the first ten years. Now, ten years is an
immense space to the individual who only commenced
with good resolutions. In that time, if he has not accumulated
actual money, he may quite well have secured good
reputation and credit, which, prudently managed, is just
money of another kind. And so, while still a young man,
he is pretty much upon a par with him who seemed to start
with such superior advantages. In fact, fortune, or original
good circumstances, appear to the present writer as
requisites of a very unimportant character, compared with
talent, power of application, self-denial, and honourable
intentions. The <em>fortunate</em>—to use the erroneous language
of common life—are selected from those who have possessed
the latter indispensable qualifications in their best
combinations: and as it is obvious that young men of fortune
(necessarily the smaller class) have only a chance,
according to their numbers, of possessing them, it follows,
as a clear induction, that the great mass of the prosperous
were originally poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talent.</span>—It is a common cry that those who succeed best
in life are the dullest people, and that talent is too fine a
quality for common pursuits. There cannot be a greater
fallacy than this. It may be true that some decidedly stupid
people succeed through the force of a dogged resolution,
which hardly any man of superior genius could have submitted
to. But I am disposed to dispute, in a great measure,
the existence of talent, where I do not find it at once
productive of superior address in ordinary affairs, and attended
by a magnanimity which elevates the possessor above
all paltry and vicious actions. The genius which only
misleads its possessor from the paths of prudence, or renders
him a ridiculous and intolerable member of society, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
too much allied to Bedlam to be taken into account; and
in reality, there is nowhere so much of what is called
genius as in the madhouses.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The imputation of dulness
to a man who has prospered in life, will be found by impartial
inquirers, in nine cases out of ten, to be a mere
consolatory appliance to the self-love of one who has neither
had the talent nor the morality to prosper in life himself.
Let every man, then, who possesses this gift, rejoice
in it with all his heart, and seek by every means to give it
proper guidance and direction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application</span> is another of the indispensable requisites.
Detached efforts, though they may individually be great,
can never tell so well in the aggregate as a regular and
constant exertion, where the doings of one day fortify and
improve the doings of the preceding, and lead on with
certainty to the better doings of the next. It is not economical
to work by fits and starts; more exertion is required,
by that system, for a certain end, than what is
necessary in the case of a continuous effort, and thus the
irregular man is apt to fall far behind his rivals. Men of
ability are apt to despise application as a mean and grubbing
qualification—which is only a piece of overweening
self-love on their part, and likely to be the very means of
frustrating all the proper results of their ability. On the
other hand, the industrious man is apt to despair for want
of ability—not seeing that the clever fellows are liable to
the weakness we describe, which causes them to be constantly
giving way in the race to mere plodders. Besides,
while few faults are more common than an over-estimation
of one’s self, it is equally obvious that many men only discover
their abilities by chance, and that all of us possess
latent powers, which might be turned to good account, if
we only knew and had confidence in them. No man, therefore,
should be too easily dashed on the subject of his abilities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
He should try, and, with the aid of a persevering
industry, he may do wonders such as he never dreamt of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Self-Denial.</span>—Perhaps among all the qualifications
which, in a combined form, lead to fortune, none is more
absolutely indispensable than this. A man may have talent,
may have application, both in abundance; but if he
cannot resist vulgar temptations, all is in vain. The
Scotch, as a nation, are characterised immensely by self-denial,
and it is the main ground of their prosperity both
at home and abroad. It is one of the noblest of the virtues,
if not, indeed, the sole virtue which creates all the rest.
If we are obliged at every moment to abandon some sacred
principle in order to gratify a paltry appetite; if the extensive
future is perpetually to be sacrificed for the sake of the
momentary present; if we are to lead a life of Esau-like
bargains from the first to the last—then we are totally unfit
for any purpose above the meanest. Self-indulgence makes
brutes out of gods; self-denial is the tangent line by which
human nature trenches upon the divine. Now, self-indulgence
is not inherent except in very few natures; it is
almost invariably the result of “evil communications” in
youth, and generally becomes a mere use or habit. The
most of error arises from the contagion of example. A
youth at first debauches himself because he sees others do
it; he feels, all the time, as if he were sacrificing merely
to the glory of bravado; and there is far more of martyrdom
in it than is generally supposed. But though a person
at first smokes in order to show how much disgust he can
endure, he soon comes to have a real liking for tobacco.
And thus, for the paltriest indulgences, which only are
so from vicious habit, and perhaps, after all, involve as
much dissatisfaction as pleasure, we daily see the most
glorious and ennobling objects cast, as it were, into hell-fire.</p>

<p>We are by no means hostile to all amusement. The
mass of men require a certain quantity of amusement almost
as regularly as their daily food. But amusement may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
be noxious or innocent, moderate or immoderate. The
amusements which can be enjoyed in the domestic circle,
or without company at all, are the safest; there is great
danger in all which require an association of individuals to
carry them into effect. Upon the whole, a multitude of
bosom friends is the most pernicious evil that ever besets
a man in the world. Each becomes a slave to the depraved
appetites of the rest, and is at last ulcerated all over
with their various evil practices. At the very best, he is
retarded to the general pace, and never finds it possible to
get a single vantage hour, in order to steal a march upon
his kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honourable Intentions</span> are also indispensably necessary.
The reverse is simply want of sense and understanding;
for it is obvious to every one who has seen the least
of human life, that infinitely more is lost in reputation and
<em>means and opportunities of well-doing</em>, by an attempt to
gain an undue advantage, than what can in general cases
be gained. If we had to live only for a short time certain,
trickery might be the most expedient course, so far as this
world is concerned; but if a man contemplates a life
above a single twelvemonth, he will endeavour, by the
guarded correctness of his actions, to acquire the good
character which tends so much to eventual prosperity.
The dishonest man, in one sense, may be termed the most
monstrous of all self-flatterers; he thinks he can cheat
the whole of the remaining part of mankind—which certainly
is no trifling compliment. He soon finds, however,
that he was seen through all the time by those whom
he thought mere children, and his blindness and silly arrogance
receive their deserved punishment. Even where
the depravity may be of a very slight kind, it is alike in
vain. In ordinary transactions, the one party deals with
the other exactly according to his character; if the one
be in general disposed to overreach, the other is just proportionably
on his guard; so that there is no result but
trouble, and a bad name. One thing should be strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
impressed upon such persons: they are far more generally
understood and watched than they are aware of; for the
world, so long as it can simply take care of itself without
much difficulty, is not disposed to adopt the dangerous task
of a monitor. The police-officer knows of many rogues
whom he passes every day on the street; he never lays
hold of any, unless for some particular offence.</p>

<p>Such are the principal qualities necessary for advancement
in life, though any one of them, without much or any
of the other, will, if not counteracted by negative properties,
be sure to command a certain degree of success. He
who is about to start in the race would do well to ponder
upon the difficulties he has to encounter, and make up a
manful resolution to meet them with a full exertion of all
his powers. To revert to the general question—what is
it that enables one man to get in advance of his fellows?
The answer is obvious: it can only be his <em>doing</em> more
than the generality of them, or his <em>enduring more privation</em>
than they are generally inclined to do [that is, self-denial],
in order that he may acquire <em>increased power of doing</em>.
The fault of most unsuccessful persons is their want of an
adequate idea of what is to be <em>done</em>, and what is to be <em>endured</em>.
They enter business as into a game or a sport, and
they are surprised, after a time, to find that there is a principle
in the affair they never before took into account—namely,
the tremendous competition of other men. Without
being able to do and suffer as much as the <em>best</em> men of
business, the <em>first</em> place is not to be gained; without being
able to do and suffer as much as the second order of
men of business, the <em>second</em> place is not to be gained; and
so on. New candidates should therefore endeavour to
make an estimate of the duties necessary for attaining a certain
point, and not permit themselves to be thrown out in
the race for want of a proper performance of those duties.
They should either be pretty certain of possessing the requisite
powers of exertion and endurance, or aim at a lower
point, to which their powers may seem certainly adequate.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is a prevailing notion, that people are all so exclusively
engrossed with their own concerns in this world, as to
have no time or opportunity to take the least interest in
those of their neighbours. No idea could be more mistaken.
The truth is, a great many people—perhaps a
<em>third</em> of the population of large towns, and <em>three-fourths</em> of
those in small ones—are far more anxious about the concerns
of their neighbours than about their own. In fact,
society in this respect resembles the ape department in a
menagerie, where, it is said, every individual chatterer
neglects his own pan of meat (opposite his cage), and
stretches with all his might to reach the mess of some distant
companion in captivity, who, on his part, tries, with
equal straining and exertion, to rob some other friend.
The case, however, differs immensely as to intention. The
monkeys, as we seriously believe, act thus from a wish to
eat all the neighbouring pans of meat in the first place,
after which they think it will be time enough to attend
coolly to their own. But human beings look after each
other’s morals and worldly prosperity through the most
generous impulses. They think it selfish to be always attending
to their own affairs, and that it would be an utter
defiance of the greatest law of nature, if they were only to
look after themselves. Our own business requires, perhaps,
the first attention, but common justice to our race
demands that all our <em>spare</em> time, at least, should be devoted
to a supervision of the concerns of other people, and a surveillance
of their moral conduct. We are to love our
neighbours as ourselves, and, in order to testify that we
love them, we are to do as we do with children, castigate
them properly whenever they misbehave.</p>

<p>It is lamentable to think how negligent some large classes
of society are respecting the affairs of their neighbours. In
large cities, the more actively engaged citizens go on from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
year to year in the pursuit of their own advantage, never
casting a single thought upon their next-door neighbours,
unless, perhaps, to make a transient inquiry into the state of
their credit. Is it not fortunate, that, while the men are
thus apt to get wrapped up in their own sordid interests,
the fairer and more generous part of the race are still in
general sufficiently at leisure to see after their neighbours?
What <em>would</em> society do without these amiable controllers-general?—or
what would society do, if these amiable controllers
were to get so much engaged too, as to have no
time for the affairs of their friends? It is dreadful even to
think of such a calamity. How many poor improvident
wretches would, in such an event, be left to sink or swim
as chance directed! How naughty the world at large
would become!</p>

<p>Let us contemplate the delightful picture of one of these
friends of society. She is generally a person very much
at leisure; for without leisure, that natural preference of
our own concerns to those of others precludes all exertion
of the faculty: she is also, in general, placed in a
tolerably secure position in the world, whence she may
survey, with compassionate and patronising eyes, the poor
strugglers beneath her. Virtuous she is, as virtuous can
be; that is to say, she is altogether beyond temptation.
Herself and all her own immediate friends have been fortunate;
therefore she has a kind of prescriptive title to
speak freely of the misfortunes of others. It is incredible
what exertions this amiable person will make to procure
data for her remarks, or, to speak more properly, grounds
whereon she may proceed in her benevolent exertions.
Charity being an excuse for every thing, she will even descend
so far from her dignity as to institute inquiries,
through servants and children, into the concerns of those
persons whom she has taken under her patronage. Her
own Betty, having the same turn with herself, takes frequent
opportunities of visiting the kitchens of her friends;
and all the remarks that the girl has been able to make upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
the external state of things there, and all the prattle she
has been able to pick up from the servants in that house,
is brought home and faithfully detailed to her mistress,
who accidentally, for that purpose, opens a conversation
with her. Nor is this all. Through the impulse of her
benevolent wishes, the good lady will often take information
from her servant, which <em>she</em> has learned from another
servant, respecting the concerns of a family in which that
other servant has perhaps a sister or a friend; her sincere
desire of doing good being so strong as to reconcile her to
every possibility of misrepresentation, which a story may
be supposed to undergo in its progress through so many
mouths. It is also to be observed, that she is not exclusively
attentive to the concerns of those whom she actually
knows. The acquaintances of her acquaintances, and
their acquaintances again, even to the third generation, she
will inquire about with equal solicitude; and if she knows
any thing disagreeable connected with your friends, or any
thing that might be thought to unfit them for your acquaintance,
she always very kindly lets you hear of it, so that you
may be <em>quite upon your guard</em>.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” the talk, perhaps, thus proceeds;
“they say she is such a <em>fine lady</em> that she never
enters her kitchen: she never knows any day what is to
be for dinner: all that kind of thing she leaves to her servants.
And such quantities of company they keep!
Hardly a night but what there are more or less visitors.
A neighbour of ours, Mrs Blackwell, has an aunt who
lives opposite them; and <em>she</em> says that the racket is without
end. I’m sure I was just saying to our goodman the
other day, that if <em>we</em> were to go on in such a way [be it
marked, the speaker is reputed to be in infinitely better
circumstances than the party commented on], we could
not go on long. Puir young things! I’m greatly concerned
about them—although, to be sure, it’s not <em>my</em> business.
I was at the school with her mother, and I would
like to see them keep right, if it were possible. Young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
folk are often newfangled about things at first. They
think every body that they see is their friend—and its
‘this one, come to your supper,’ and ‘that one, come to
your dinner,’ as if they could not get past it. When they
come to my time o’ life, they’ll not be sae flush.”</p>

<p>“They say she’s highly accomplished,” thus runs another
strain of remarks; “plays on the piano-forte and
harp—draws—speaks French and Italian. That would
be all very well if <em>he</em> had a fortune to keep it up; but a
poor man’s wife! Commend me to a woman that can
darn her husband’s stockings, and help to get ready his
dinner. I think there’s naething like a gude plain education—reading,
writing, and sewing—what mair does a woman
need? The goodman and I were often advised to
send our girls to learn music, but I never thought it their
station. It just puts a parcel o’ nonsense into a girl’s
head. Our lasses never learned ony thing but what they
could mak a gude use o’; while, there’s Mary Foster does
nothing but read novells from morning till night; she’s one
o’ your fine misses. If our girls were to bring a novell
into our house, I would put it at the back of the fire,
though there was na another novell i’ the world.”</p>

<p>It is said that in nunneries, where there is neither vice,
nor the possibility of it, the ladies, if unable to talk real
scandal, make up for it by censorious remarks upon the
most trifling foibles in their companions, or upon the most
unimportant failures in the performance of the most unimportant
duties. If a holy sister has been observed to smile
at a wrong moment, if she has miscounted a bead, or tripped
in her gown while walking in a procession, there is as
much prattle about it as if she had committed a real offence.
Just so, in a country town, every trivial incident
becomes a subject of comment for those amiable people
who make a point of attending to every body’s business
but their own. The consequence is, that every person
moves in a country town as if he were upon an ambuscading
party: he sends by stratagem for every necessary of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
which he requires: he takes all kinds of by-ways and back
roads to escape observation, and cannot so much as cross
the street without fearing he will be circumvented. Any
thing like a good round thumping impropriety is hailed in
such a place like rain in a drought. The most of the matters
of remark are very small deer, hardly worth hunting
down. When one of a more important character arises,
it is quite a godsend. Suppose, for instance, the failure of
some unfortunate merchant, who has been ruined by mere
simplicity of character. The country people, somehow,
have a most exaggerated idea of the mischiefs of bankruptcy.
A bankrupt, in their eyes, is a person of distinguished criminality—almost
enough to make him be regarded as a
world’s wonder. In proportion, therefore, to their previous
remarks for the edification of the unhappy man, is
their wholesome severity afterwards. They are surprised
to find that, after such an event, he still bears the ordinary
shape of a human being—that he has not become signalised
by some external transfiguration, of a kind sufficiently awful
to indicate his offence. Another thing they are astonished
at—that the family of a bankrupt should continue
to have the usual appetites of human beings—that they
should not, indeed, have altogether ceased to eat, drink,
or sleep. The following is very nearly a conversation
which really occurred, on such an occasion, in a somewhat
humble rank of mercantile life.</p>

<p>“Weel, hae ye heard the news?”</p>

<p>“What news, woman?”</p>

<p>“Ou, hae ye no heard it?—James Sinclair’s shop’s no
open this mornin’—that’s a’.”</p>

<p>“Aih, weel, has it come to that at last? I aye thought
it. It was easy seeing <em>yon</em> could na stand lang. Sic ongauns
as they had for a while—sic dresses—sic parties!
But every thing comes to its level at last. I wonder folk
dinna think shame to gang on sae wi’ other folk’s siller.
It’s a perfect black-burning disgrace. And <em>she’s</em> just as
muckle to blame as <em>him</em>. There was hersell, just last Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
eight days, at the kirk wi’ a new pelisse and a bannet,
and the laddies ilk ane o’ them wi’ new leather caps. I’se
warrand there was nae bannocks ever seen in their house—naething
but gude wheat bread. Whenever a bairn
whinged for a piece, it buid to get a shave o’ the laiff.
Atweel, her grandfather, auld George Morrison, was na
sae ill to serve. Mony a claut o’ cauld parritch he gat frae
my aunty Jess, and was thankfu’ to get them.”</p>

<p>“Na, but, woman, I saw Jamie himsell gaun up the
street this mornin’, and a superfine coat on his back just
the same as ever. Na, the lass was seen this forenoon
getting a leg o’ lamb—a fifteenpence leg it was, for our
Jenny got the neebor o’t—the same as if naething ava
had happened. But, of course, this’ll no gang on lang.
They’ll be roupit out, stab and stow, puir thochtless creatures;
and I’m sure I dinna ken what’s to come o’ them.
She has nae faither’s house to gang back to now. They’ll
hae to set up some bit sma’ public, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Heaven keep us a’ frae extravagance—I had never
ony brow o’ that new plan she had o’ pitting black silk
ribands round the callants’ necks, instead o’ cotton napkins.”</p>

<p>Such are a few of the remarks of our good friends the
controllers-general of society; and we are very sure that
few people alive but what must look upon them as a most
useful, most exemplary, and most benevolent class of persons.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_TURN_FOR_BUSINESS">A TURN FOR BUSINESS.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Next to a thorough grounding in good principles, perhaps
the thing most essential to success in life is a habit of communicating
easily with the world. By entering readily into
conversation with others, we not only acquire information
by being admitted to the stores which men of various modes
of thinking have amassed, and thereby gain an insight into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the peculiarities of human character, but those persons into
whose society we may be accidentally thrown are gratified
to think that they have been able to afford instruction.
Seeing that we appreciate their favourite subject, they conceive
a high opinion of our penetration, and not unfrequently
exert themselves wonderfully to promote our
interests. Men in business, particularly, who have this
happy turn of being able to slide as it were into discourse,
and to throw it into that train which is best suited to the
capacities and humours of others, are wonderfully indebted
to it for the run of customers it entices to their shops. A
stately, grave, or solemn manner, is very inappropriate in
measuring stuffs by the yard; and though a man be penetrated
by the deepest sense of gratitude, if his bow be
stiff, and his countenance not of a relaxing cast, he makes
not half so favourable an impression as another who may
not perhaps be a more deserving person in the main, but
has a more graceful method of acknowledging his obligations.
It is astonishing, too, at how cheap a rate good-will
is to be purchased. An insinuating way of testifying
satisfaction with the pleasantness of the weather, is often
a very effectual way of extending popularity; it is regarded
as an act of condescension when addressed to some, while
with others it is received as the indication of a happy temperament,
which is at all times attractive. A person who
“has little to say,” or, in other words, who does not deign
to open his mouth except when it is indispensably necessary,
never proves generally acceptable. You will hear such a
one described as “a very good sort of man <em>in his way</em>;”
but people rather avoid him. He has neither the talent of
conversing in an amusing vein himself, nor of leading on
others to do so; and they are only the arrantest babblers
who are contented with an inanimate listener. I remember
a striking example of the various fortune of two persons
in the same profession, who happened to be of those different
dispositions.</p>

<p>Two pedlars made their rounds in the same district of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
country. The one was a tall, thin man, with a swarthy
complexion. Nothing could exceed this fellow’s anxiety to
obtain customers; his whole powers seemed to be directed
to the means of disposing of his wares. He no sooner
arrived at a farm-house than he broached the subject
nearest his heart—“Any thing wanted in my line to-day?”
He entered into a most unqualified eulogium on their excellency;
they were all unequalled in fineness; he could
sell them for what might be said to be absolutely nothing;
and as for lasting, why, to take his word for it, they would
wear for ever. He chose the table where the light was
most advantageous, proceeded immediately to undo the labyrinth
of cord with which his goods were secured, and
took the utmost pains to exhibit their whole glories to the
eyes of the admiring rustics. If the farmer endeavoured
to elicit from him some information concerning the state of
the crops in the places where he had been travelling, he
could only afford a brief and unsatisfactory answer, but was
sure to tack to the tail of it the recommendation of some
piece of west of England cloth which he held in his hand
ready displayed. Nay, if the hospitality of the good wife
made him an offer of refreshment before he entered upon
business, he most magnanimously, but unpedlar-like, resisted
the temptation to eat, animated by the still stronger
desire to sell. There was no possibility of withdrawing
him for a moment from his darling topic. To the master
he said, “Won’t you buy a coat?”—to the mistress,
“Won’t you buy a shawl?”—to the servant girls, “Won’t
you buy a gown a-piece?” and he earnestly urged the
cowherd to purchase a pair of garters, regardless of the
notorious fact that the ragged urchin wore no stockings.
But all his efforts were ineffectual; even his gaudiest
ribands could not melt the money out of a single female
heart; and his vinegar aspect grew yet more meagre as he
restored each article untouched to his package.</p>

<p>The rival of this unsuccessful solicitor of custom was a
short, squat man, fair-haired and ruddy. He came in with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
a hearty salutation, and set down his pack in some corner,
where, as he expressed himself, it might be “out of the
way.” He then immediately abandoned himself to the full
current of conversation, and gave a detail of every particular
of news that was within his knowledge. He could
tell the farmer every thing that he desired to know—what
number of corn-stalks appeared in the barn-yards wherever
he had been, and what quantity of grain still remained
uncut or in shock, and he took time to enumerate the
whole distinctly. He was equally well prepared in other
departments of intelligence, and so fascinating was his gossip,
that, when the duties of any member of the family
called them out of hearing, they were apt to linger so long,
that the goodwife declared he was “a perfect offput to a’
wark.” This, however, was not meant to make him abate
of his talkative humour; and neither did he: the whole
budget was emptied first, and he received in turn the narratives
of all and sundry. Then came the proposal from
some of those whom he had gratified with his news, to
“look what was in the pack.” The goods were accordingly
lugged from their place of concealment, and every
one’s hand was ready to pick out some necessary or some
coveted piece of merchandise. The master discovered
that, as he would be needing a suit ere long, it was as
well to take it now. The mistress was just waiting for
Thomas coming round to supply herself with a variety of
articles, “for,” quoth she, “mony things are needit in
a house.” The servants exhorted each other to think
whether they did not require something, for it was impossible
to say when another opportunity of getting it might
occur. The ellwand was forthwith put into diligent requisition,
the scissors snipt a little bit of the selvage, and
an adroit “screed” separated the various cloths from the
rapidly diminishing webs. The corners of many chests
gave up their carefully-hoarded gains, with which cheap
remnants were triumphantly secured. In the midst of this
transfer of finery, the poor herd-boy looked on with a countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
so wofully expressive of the fact that he had not
a farthing to spend, that some one took compassion on him,
and, having laid out a trifling sum, had the satisfaction of
making him perfectly happy with the equivalent, flinging
it into his unexpectant arms, and exclaiming, “Here,
callant, there’s something for you!” What a multiplicity
of pleasing emotions had this trader the tact of calling into
exercise, all of them redounding tenfold to his own proper
advantage! It was impossible to say whether he cultivated
his powers of talk from forethought, as knowing
that they would produce a crisis favourable to his own
interests, or if he indulged in them because gossiping was
congenial to his own disposition. He had a sharp eye
enough to what is called the main chance; but at the same
time he did not possess that degree of intellectual depth
which we might expect to find in one who could calculate
upon exciting the purchasing propensities by a method so
indirect. Most probably, therefore, his success in business
was more the result of an accidental cast of mind than of
wisdom prepense, or any aptitude beyond common for the
arts of traffic, as considered by themselves.</p>

<p>Such, also, in most cases, is that talent which gets the
name of “a fine turn for business.” The possessor exerts
his powers of pleasing, alike when engaged in the concerns
of his profession, and in society when there is no object to
serve but that of passing time agreeably. His engaging
address is productive of commercial advantages, but it is
not a thing acquired and brought into exercise solely for
that end. Some people, no doubt, finding themselves to
have a prepossessing manner, do employ it systematically
to promote their views of business; but by far the greater
number employ it because they have it, and without reference
to the pecuniary profit that may accrue. The
pecuniary profit, however, follows not the less as its consequence;
and we have the satisfaction of seeing urbanity
of manners almost uniformly rewarded by attaining to easy
circumstances, while the man of a gruff unsocial humour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
has usually to maintain a hard struggle with fortune. The
mere packing of knowledge into the heads of children is
not the only thing required to ensure their future respectability
and happiness—the qualities of the heart also demand
the fostering care of the instructor; and since so
much depends on their temper and behaviour to those
around them, parents cannot be too assiduous in the cultivation
of affability, the possession of which virtue is the
grand secret that confers “a fine turn for business.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="SETTING_UP">SETTING UP.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">The taking of a shop, whether to set up a new business
or translate an old one, is always a matter of deep and
anxious concernment. On such an occasion, one generally
gets into a state of fidgetiness and perplexity, which
is felt to be far from disagreeable. A sentiment of unwonted
enterprise rises in his mind. He is going, he
thinks, to do a great thing—at least something beyond the
usual range of commercial existence. In the first place,
he pays a few sly and solitary visits to the place—not that
he goes in to look about him—no, no; he is not for some
time up to that point. He tries first how the premises
look when simply walked past as if by an unconcerned
passenger. As he passes, he casts an affectedly careless
glance at the door and windows, taking care, however, to
receive as deep an impression as possible of the whole bearing
and deportment of the place. After walking to a sufficient
distance, he turns and walks back, and sees how it
looks when approached from a different point of the compass.
Then he takes a turn along the other side of the
street, or perhaps, if afraid to excite observation (and if the
place be in Edinburgh), goes up a common stair, and takes
a deliberate and secure observation from a window. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
feeling is almost exactly the same as that of a lover making
observations of a mistress, whose figure he wishes to ascertain
before getting too deeply in love with her to put
correct judgment out of the question. As, in the one case,
stature is perhaps considered, complexion and outline of
face duly weighed, and possibly some very modest inquiries
instituted as to what Master Slender calls “possibilities,”
so, in the other, does the shop-inspector consider all the
particulars of the aspect and likelihood of the contemplated
premises. Shops, it must be understood, have characters,
exactly like human beings. Some have an open, generous,
promising countenance, while others have a contracted,
sinister, louring expression of phiz, according to the quantity
of mason-work there may be in front. Some are of a
far more <em>accessible</em> character than others, with a kind of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facilis descensus</i> in the entry that is in the highest degree
favourable to custom. People can hardly avoid falling into
such shops as they pass along the streets, for positively
they gape like so many Scyllas for your reception, and
goodwives, who, like Roderigo, have put money in their
purses, are caught like so many rats without thinking of it.
There are others, I grieve to say, with such a difficulty of
entrance, either from a narrow door, a shut door, an elevation
of the pavement, or a certain distance from the thoroughfare,
that it requires an absolute determination to
purchase such and such articles in such and such shops—a
full <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animus emendi</i>, as lawyers would say—to overcome
the obstacle. Perhaps it does not matter for some businesses,
which are not much overrun with competition, that
they should be carried on in shops of this kind. If there
be only one music-seller in the town, he might have his
boutique in a twelfth story, and yet he would be sure to
get all the natural custom of the place; but in the case of
one out of some five hundred haberdashers, or some two
thousand grocers, it is absolutely imperative that he should
be established in some place with a fatal facility of access.
In all cases, there is a combination of qualities in shops, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
well as in men and women. There is something indescribable
about it; but an experienced eye, pretty well acquainted
with the characters of the streets [this is another
subject] and parts of streets, could almost in a moment
decide upon the probabilities of any given shop in a large
city. He would combine in an instant in his own mind
the various qualities, and, counting them into each other
after the manner of Lieutenant Drummond, but by a
figureless kind of arithmetic, assign at once the exact value
of the shop to any class of traders. And shops have characters,
too, in another sense of the word—that is, they
have reputations. Let a shop have all the apparent advantages
in the world, yet, if it be a shop in which several
persons have committed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i> in business, it is naught.
We often see an excellent shop thus lose caste, as it were,
and become of hardly any value to its proprietor. Suppose
some one has failed in it between terms, and deserted it:
then do all the bill-stickers come in the first place, and
paste it over with huge placards from top to bottom, exactly
as a man drowned in the sea, however fine a fellow he may
have been, gets encased in a few days in barnacles and
shell-fish, the conchological part of the world taking that
opportunity to show their contempt for the human.
Though the character of the shop is not yet, perhaps, at
its worst, yet, as it happens to remain unleased over the
next term, the despairing landlord, some time in September
or October, begins to let it “by the month or week”
to all kinds of nameless people, who die and make no <em>sign</em>,
such as men that show orreries, or auctioneers selling off
bankrupt stocks, till at last it is as hopeless to think of
getting a good tenant into it, as for a man with a bad character
to expect a good place in the Excise. The shop is
marked for ever; and unless, like the man in the Vicar of
Wakefield, it can get a thoroughly new face and form, it
has no chance whatsoever of resuming its place in the first
rank of shops.</p>

<p>After having completely made up his mind to take a particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
shop, he goes and asks advice. His confessor<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
readily consents to take a walk with him in that direction,
and give his candid opinion upon the subject. The two
walk arm in arm past the premises, the confessor alone
looking, lest, in endeavouring to observe, they should
themselves be observed. “I’ll tell you what,” says the
confessor, “I like that shop very much. If the rent be at all
suitable, I think you might do very well in it.” It is then
proposed that the confessor should step in to inquire the
rent; for though there be equal reasons why each should
not expose himself as being on the outlook for a shop, the
person not actually concerned has always least reluctance
to submit to that disadvantage, being borne up, it would
appear, by a conscious absence of design, while the guilt
of the other would be betrayed by his first question. If
the confessor reports favourably, then the individual who
wants the premises ventures in himself, inspects the accommodations,
and makes farther inquiries. The two
afterwards retire together, and have a deep and serious
consultation upon the subject.</p>

<p>In the deliberations of a person about to enter life in
this way, there is always much that is extravagant, and
much that is vague. I never yet knew it fail, that, if there
was success at all, it arose from different sources from those
which had been most securely calculated upon as likely to
produce it. Suppose it is a business for the supply of some
ordinary necessary of life: the novice reckons up almost
all the people he knows in different parts of the town, as
sure to become his customers; he expects, indeed, hardly
any other kind of support. It is found, however, when
he commences, that one friend is engaged in one way, and
another in another, so that, with the exception, perhaps,
of some benevolent old lady, who sends occasionally to
buy a few trifles from him <em>upon principle</em>, all is waste and
barren where he expected to reap a plentiful harvest. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
finds, however, on the other hand, that he gets customers
where he did not expect them. People seem to rise out of
the earth, like the men of Cadmus, to buy from him. The
truth is, he is resorted to by those who are disengaged at
the time, and to whom his shop is convenient; and all the
good-will of all the friends in the world will not get over,
for his sake, the difficulty of some engagement elsewhere,
or the inconvenience of distance.</p>

<p>It is also a very remarkable thing of people about to enter
upon such an enterprise as we are now describing, that
they often overlook the most important considerations of
all and pay a very minute attention to trifles and things by
the by. They perhaps fail to observe that there is not
nearly enough of population around them to justify their
setting up a particular business; but they fully appreciate
and lay great stress upon the circumstance of having a water-pipe
in the back room, by which they may be enabled
to wash their hands at any time of the day. They may
neither have capital nor range of intellect for the business;
but they are top-sure that the woman who sells small wares
in the area will supply them with a light for the fire every
morning. The shop may be unsuitable in many important
respects; but nothing could be better in its way than
the place for a sign above the door. Even where every
matter of real consequence is well weighed and found answerable,
there is generally a fussy and festering anxiety
about details, accompanied, in the sensations of the principal
party, by peculiar dryness of mouth and excoriation
of thought-chewed lip. Matters may be such that a confessor,
with all the evil-foreboding qualities of a stormy-peterel,
could not see a single flaw in the prospect; yet it
is amusing in such cases to hear the intending trader laying
as much stress upon the peculiar situation of a fire-place
in the back room, or the willingness of the landlord to
supply a padlock to the door, as if in these things, and in
nothing else, lay all his hopes of profit and eventual respectability
in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>Suppose, however, that, after all kinds of fond and dreamy
calculations, the shop has been taken and opened. I think
there can hardly, for some time, be a more interesting sight
to a benevolent on-looker, than the young and anxious trader.
The shop almost throws itself out at the windows to
attract the observation of the passer by. The youth himself
stands prompt and alert behind his counter, never idling for a
moment, nor permitting his shopboy to idle, but both busy,
cutting, and brushing, and bustling about, whether there
be any thing to do or not. If but an old lady be seen looking
up at the window, or glancing in through the avenue
of cheap prints that forms the doorway, what an angler-like
eagerness in the mind of the trader that she would but
<em>walk in</em>!—nothing more required—were she once within
the shop, no fear but she is well done for. And when any
body does go in to buy any thing, what a readiness to fly upon
the article wanted—with what serviceable rapidity of finger
is the parcel unbound—how polite and <em>impressé</em> the
manner in which the object is presented and laid out for
inspection—what intense gratitude for the money wherewith
it is paid! With what a solicitous air is a card finally
put into your hand as a memorandum of the place!—a
proceeding only the more eloquent when not accompanied
by an actual request for your farther custom.</p>

<p>In a large city, advertising is necessarily resorted to as
one of the modes, if not almost the only mode, of forming
a business. Here it is obvious that a mere modest statement
of the case will not do. Something must be said, to
make the setting up of the new shop appear in the character
of an <em>event</em>. The public attention must be arrested
to the circumstance, as if it were a matter of public concernment.
It must appear as if the interest of the community,
and the interest of the shopman, were identified.
No good bargains, no certainty of good articles, no safety of
any kind, any where else. Such is the strain of his advertisements,
which, though they make the judicious grieve,
make a vast number of other people, and even some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
judicious, buy. The secret is this: A warm and highly
coloured style is necessary with a new shopkeeper, to meet
and counteract the indifference of the public towards his
concerns. If he put forth a cool schedule of his goods
and chattels, it does nothing for him, because it does not
single him out from the great herd. But if he uses a striking
and emphatic phraseology, and even mixes a little
extravagance in the composition, it is apt to fix attention
to him and his shop; and the people, being so warmly
solicited, go to try. Again (and here, perhaps, lies the better
part of the thing), the frequency and fervour of his
advertisements at least convey the impression that he is
anxious for business, and ready and willing to execute it;
and as people like to deal with such persons, he is apt to
be resorted to on that account, if upon no other. Frequent
advertising is, upon the whole, a mark rather of a want of
business, than of that kind of respectability which consists
in the enjoyment of a concern already in full operation and
productiveness; but with beginners, it is quite indispensable.</p>

<p>The difficulty of establishing a new business is fortunately
got over in a small degree by a certain benevolent
principle in human nature—a disposition to encourage the
efforts of the young. Some people act so much under this
sentiment, or have such an appetite for the sincere thanks
of the needy, that they go to hardly any shops but those
of new beginners. The sight of a haberdasher’s shop, in
its first and many-coloured dawn, with prints, and ribands,
and shop-bills, flying in all directions—or of a provision
shop, where hams project their noses into the very teeth,
almost, of the passer by, and cheeses lie gaping with a
quarter cut out, as if ready to eat rather than to be eaten—or
of a bookseller’s shop, where every fresh and trig volume
upon the counter seems as if it would take the slightest
hint of your will, and, starting up, pack itself off, without
any human intervention whatsoever, to your lodgings—is
irresistible to these people. They must go in, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
they want any thing or not, and, after buying some trifle
as an earnest of future custom, get themselves delighted
with a full recital of all the young trader’s feelings, and
prospects, and capabilities, which he is ready to disclose to
any one that will lay out sixpence, and appear to take an
interest in his undertaking. If the customer be an old lady,
she is interested in his youth, and inquires whether he be
married or not. If not, then she wants him to get on well,
so that he may soon be able to have a wife; if he be, and
have children, then she sympathises but the more keenly;
she thinks how much human happiness depends upon the
success or failure of his undertaking—how one fond soul
will watch with intense anxiety the daily progress of the
business, taking an interest in almost every penny that
comes in, and how many little mouths unconsciously depend
upon what is done <em>here</em>, for the fare which childhood
so much requires and so truly enjoys. She goes away,
resolved to speak of the shop to all she knows, and perhaps
in two or three days she is able to bring in a flock of
young ladies who want various articles, and who, recommending
the new beginner to others, aid materially in
making up the steady business, which, with economy, perseverance,
and suitable personal qualities, he at length
acquires.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The population of a large town is perpetually receiving
accessions from the country—not for the purpose of increasing
the aggregate of inhabitants, but to supply the
waste of existence which takes place in such a scene, and
to furnish a better selection for the peculiar offices and
business of a city than what could be obtained from the
successive generations of the ordinary inhabitants. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
can be more clear than that the youths born and
bred in a large city have a less chance to establish themselves
in its first-rate lines of business, than the lads who
come in from the country as adventurers; the fact being,
that the latter are a selection of stirring clever spirits from
a large mass, while only the same proportion of the former
are likely to possess the proper merit or aptitude. Besides,
the town-bred lad is apt to have some points of silly pride
about his status in society; he cannot do this and he cannot
do that, for fear of the sneers of the numerous contemporaries
under whose eyes he is always walking. But
the gilly, hot from Banff or Inverness, who comes into the
town, “with bright and flowing hair,” rugging and riving for a
place in some writer’s office, or elsewhere—why, the fellow
would push into the most sacred parts of a man’s house, like
Roderick Random, and at the most unconscionable hours, in
search of some prospective situation; and when he has got
it, what cares he about what he does (within honesty) in order
to advance himself, seeing that all whoever knew him before
are on the other side of the Grampians. Thus, the sons
of the respectable people of large cities are constantly retiring
from the field—some to the East Indies, some to the
West—some evanish nobody knows how—while their places
are taken by settlers from all parts of the country, whose
children, in their turn, give way to fresh importations. Then,
there is a constant tide towards the capital, of all kinds of
rural people, who, having failed to improve their fortunes
in the country, are obliged to try what may be done in the
town. A broken-down country merchant sets up a grocery
shop in some suburb—a farmer who has been obliged
to relinquish his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulcia arva</i>, sets up an hostelry for carriers,
and so forth. Every recurrence of Whitsunday and Martinmas
sends in large droves of people on the tops of
heavy carts, to pitch their camps in Edinburgh; many of
them with but very uncertain prospects of making a livelihood
when they get there, but yet the most of them astonished
a year or two after to find that they are still living,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
with the children all at the school as formerly, although,
to be sure, the “reeky toun” can never be like the green
meadows and dear blue hills which they have left behind
in Menteith, or Ayrshire, or Tweeddale. What change,
to be sure, to these good people, is the close alley of the
Old Town of Edinburgh, the changeless prospect of house
tops and chimneys, and the black wall opposite to their
windows, ever casting its dark shade into their little apartments,
for the pleasant open fields in which they have
sown and reaped for half a lifetime, and where every little
rustic locality is endeared to them by a thousand delightful
recollections! But yet it is amazing how habit and necessity
will reconcile the mind to the most alien novelties.
And, even here, there are some blessings. The place of
worship (always an important matter to decent country
people in Scotland) is perhaps nearer than it used to be.
Mr Simpson’s chapel in the Potterrow is amazingly convenient.
Education for the children, though dearer, is
better and more varied. There is also a better chance of
employment for the youngsters when they grow up. Then
Sandy Fletcher, the —— carrier, goes past the door every
Wednesday, with a cart-load of home reminiscences, and
occasionally a letter or a parcel from some friend left at
the place which they have deserted. By means of this
excellent specimen of corduroyed honesty and worth, they
still get all their butter and cheese from the sweet pastures
of their own country side, so that every meal almost
brings forward some agreeable association of what, from
feeling as well as habit, they cannot help still calling <em>home</em>.
Then it is always made a point with them to plant themselves
in an outskirt of the town, corresponding to the part
of the country from which they come, and where they
think they will have at least a specimen of the fresh air.
A Clydesdale family, for instance, hardly ever thinks of
taking a house (at least for the first year or two) any where
but in the Grassmarket, or about Lauriston, or the Canal
Basin. People from East Lothian harbour about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
Canongate. Bristo Street and the Causewayside are appropriated
indefeasibly to settlers from Selkirkshire and
Peeblesshire. Poll the people thereabouts, and you will
find a third of them natives of those two counties. In
fact, the New Town, or any thing beyond the Cowgate,
is a kind of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra borealis incognita</i> to folk from the south
of Scotland. They positively don’t know any thing about
those places, except, perhaps, by report. Well, it must
certainly be agreeable, if one is banished from the country
into a town, at least to dwell in one of the outlets towards
<em>that part of the country</em>; so that the exile may now and
then cast his thoughts and his feelings straight along the
highway towards the place endeared to him; and if he
does not see the hills which overlook the home of his heart,
at least, perhaps, hills from which he knows he can see
other hills, from which the spot is visible—the long stages
of fancy in straining back to the place</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“——He ne’er forgets, though there he is forgot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is one other grand source of comfort—in fact, an
indispensable convenience—to people from the country
living in a large city, namely, <span class="smcap">Consuls</span>. Every person in
the circumstances described must be familiar with the character
and uses of a <span class="smcap">Consul</span>, though perhaps they never
heard the <em>name</em> before. The truth is, as from every district
of broad Scotland there are less or more settlers of all
kinds of ranks and orders, so among these there is always
one family or person who serves to the occasional visitors
from that part of the country, as well as to the regular settlers,
all the purposes which a commercial Consul serves
in a foreign port. The house of this person is a <em>howff</em>, or
place of especial resort, to all and sundry connected with
that particular locality. It is, in fact, the Consul-house
of the district. Sometimes, when there is a considerable
influx from a particular place, there is a Consul for almost
every order of persons connected with that place, from the
highest to the lowest. The Consul is a person—generally
an old lady—of great kindliness of disposition, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
never can be put about by a visit at any time upon the
most vaguely general invitation. Generally, a kind of open
table—a tea-table it is—is kept every Sunday night, which
is resorted to by all and sundry, like an “at home” in high
life; and though the Consul herself and some of her family
sit on certain defined and particular chairs during the
whole evening, the rest are tenanted by relays of fresh
visitors almost every hour, who pay their respects, take a
cup, and, after a little conversation, depart. In general,
the individuals resorting to these houses are as familiar
with every particular of the system of the tea-table—yea,
with every cracked cup, and all the initials upon the
silver spoons—as the honest Consul herself. Community
of nativity is the sole bond of this association, but hardly
any could be stronger. A person from the country takes
little interest in the gossip of the city, important as it
may sometimes be. He likes to hear of all that is going
on in the little village or parish from which he has been
transplanted. All this, and more, he hears at the house
of the Consul for that village, or parish, the same as you
will be sure to find a London newspaper in the house of
the British resident at Lisbon. Any death that may have
happened there since his last visit—any birth—any marriage—any
anything—he gets all in right trim at the Consul-house,
with all the proper remarks, the whole having been
imported on Thursday in the most regular manner by the
carrier, or else on some other day by a visitant, who, though
only a few hours in town, was sure to call <em>there</em>. At the
Consul-house you will hear how the minister is now liked—who
is likely to get most votes in the coming election—from
whom Mrs —— bought her china when she was about
to be married—and the promise of the crops, almost to a
sheaf or a potato. But the topics are of endless variety.
One thing is remarkable. The most determined scandal
is bandied about respecting their ancient neighbours; and
yet they all conspire to think that there is no sort of people
to be compared with them in the mass. They will let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
nobody talk ill of them but themselves. There is sometimes
a considerable difference in the characters and
ranks of the individuals who frequent a Consul-house.
Perhaps you find, among persons of higher degree and
more dignified age, apprentice lads, who, being the children
of old acquaintances of the Consul, are recommended
by their mothers to spend their Sunday evenings here, as
under a vicarial eye of supervision, and being sure to be
out of harm’s way in the house of so respectable a person.
These stolid youths, with their raw untamed faces, form
a curious contrast, occasionally, to the more polished individuals
who have been longer about town, such as writers’
clerks or licentiates of the church. Possibly they will
sit you out five mortal hours in a Consul-house, without
ever speaking a word, or even shifting their position on
their chairs, staring with unvaried eyes, and hands compressed
between knees, right into the centre of the room, and
hearing all that is going on as if they heard not. At length
the young cub rises to go away, and the only remark is,
“Well, Willie, are you going home? Good-night.” After
which, the Consul only remarks to the adults around her,
“That’s ane o’ John Anderson’s laddies—a fine quiet callant.”
But this holds good only respecting Consuls in a
certain walk of life. There are houses where people of
very high <em>style</em>, from a particular district, are wont to call
and converse; and there are dens in the inferior parts of
the town, to which only serving girls or boys (there is no
rank among boys) resort. Every place, every rank, has
its Consul. And not only is the Consul valuable as an
individual who keeps a Sunday evening conversazione.
She actually does a great deal of business for the particular
district which she represents. If a townswoman wants a
gown dyed, or to obtain <em>swatches</em> of some new prints, or to
purchase any peculiar article which requires some address
in the purchasing, then is the Consul resorted to. A little
square inexplicable epistle, with not nearly enough of
fold to admit a wafer, and the phrase “for goods” on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
corner, supposed to be a kind of shibboleth that exempts
letters from the laws of the Post-office, comes in with the
carrier, requesting that Mrs —— will be so good as go to
this or that shop, and do this and that and t’other thing,
and send the whole out by return of Pate Fairgrieve, and the
payment will be rendered at next visit to town. Thus the
Consul is a vast commission-agent, with only this difference,
that she makes nothing by it to compensate her immense
outlay of capital. The duties, however, of the Consulate
are their own reward; and we doubt if Brutus, who first assumed
the office, bore it with a prouder head or more satisfied
heart, than many individuals whom we could point out.
Henceforth, we do not doubt, people will refer to the days
when such and such a person was Consul for their native
village, in a style similar to the ancient chronology of
Rome; and “Consule Tullo” itself will not be more familiar
or more memorable language, than “in the Consulate
[shall we so suppose?] of Mrs Bathgate!”</p>

</div>


<p class="no-indent">The exact balance of favours in ordinary acquaintanceship
is a matter very difficult to be adjusted. Sometimes
people think they are giving more entertainments than they
get, and on other occasions you would suppose that they
are mortally offended at their friends for not coming oftener
to eat of their meat and drink of their cup. It is hard to
say whether a desire of reserving or of squandering victuals
predominates; for though one would argue that it is more
natural to keep what one has than to give it away for nothing,
yet, to judge by the common talk of the world, you
are far more likely to give offence by coming too seldom
than by coming too often to the tables of your friends.
From this cause, I have often been amused to hear people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
about whose company I was not very solicitous, making
the most abject apologies for having visited me so seldom
of late, but promising to behave a great deal better for the
future—that is to say, to give me henceforward much more
of what I never desired before, even in the smallest portions.</p>

<p>But this kindness of language is not confined to the
party threatening a visit: the party threatened is also
given to use equally sweet terms of discourse. “Really,
you have been a great stranger lately. We thought we
never were to see you again. What is there to hinder
you of an evening to come over and chat a little, or take
a hand with the Doctor and Eliza at whist? We are always
so happy to see you. I assure you we are resolved
to take it very ill; and if you don’t repay our last visit, we
will never see you again.” With an equally amiable sincerity,
the shocking person with whom you have been long
quite tired, having ceased to gain any amusement or any
eclat from the acquaintance, replies, “I must confess I
<em>have</em> been very remiss. Indeed, I was so ashamed of not
having called upon you for such a length of time, that I
could not venture to do it. But, now that the ice is broken,
I really <em>will</em> come some night soon. You may <em>depend</em>
upon it.” And so the two part off their several ways, the
one surprised at having been betrayed into so many expressions
of kindness towards an individual about whom he or
she is quite indifferent, and the other, either benevolently
resolving, in the simplicity of his heart, to pay the promised
visit, or as much surprised at having been brought into
circumstances where he was reduced to make such a promise—which,
however, as he is sure to forget it in a few
minutes, is a matter of very little moment. If these, however,
be the puzzlements which beset a town acquaintanceship,
ten times more difficult is it to adjust the mutual
rights and balance of advantages appertaining to one in
which the one party is of the town, and the other of the
country. In most such cases, either the one party or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
other has great and real cause of complaint. For example,
a citizen of tolerable style, who has been confined to some
laborious employment all the year round, amidst gas-light
within doors, and a foggy and smoky atmosphere without,
with what delight does he throw himself into the country
some fine sunshiny day in September, for the purpose of
paying a long-promised visit of three days to a country
friend! He is received with boundless hospitality. The
best bed-room, situated in that part of the house where you
generally find a city drawing-room, is aired and provided
in the most agreeable manner for his accommodation. The
goodman rides about with him all day, and dines and drinks
with him all night, except during those intervals when the
lady or her daughters solace him with tunes on the piano,
learned many years ago at a boarding-school in town. The
whole house, in fact, from the worthy agriculturist-in-chief
to the chicken that has latest chipped in the barn-yard, are
at his service, and he drinks in health, and rapture, and a
taste for natural objects, every hour. The three days are
imperceptibly elongated to as many weeks, till at last he has
become just like one of the family, calls the lady goodwife,
and the daughters by their abbreviated Christian names,
and is a very brother and more to his excellent entertainer.
At length, replenished with as much health as will serve
him through a whole twelvemonth of city life, rosy in
cheek and in gill, sturdy as a pine on the hills, and thickened
immensely about the centre of his person, he finds it
necessary to take his leave. The whole of the worthy
ruralists gather about him, and, as if not satisfied with
what they have already done for him while he was in their
presence, load him with other acts of kindness, the effect
of which is only to be experienced on the way, or after
he has reached his own home. If he could carry a ewe
cheese on each side, like the bottles of John Gilpin, they
would have no objection to give them. In fact, there is
no bounds to the kindness, the sincere heartfelt kindness,
of these people, except his capacity or willingness to receive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
Of course, he feels all this most warmly for the
time; and while the impression is strong upon him, he
counter-invites right and left. The goodman is never to
be a day in town without coming to take pot-luck. The
ladies are to come in next winter, on purpose, and have a
month of the amusements of the town, residing in his house.
Any of their friends whatsoever, even unto the fourth
generation, or no generation at all, he will be delighted to
see, whenever they are in the city. He throws himself,
his bosom, his house—all, all, open to them. But what
is the real result of all this? He goes back to town,
and resumes the serious labours of his profession. The
roses fade from his cheeks, and gratitude from his heart.
Some day, when he is up to the ears in a mysterious green
box, like a pig in his trough, or a pullet in a well; or perhaps
some day as he is rushing swiftly along the streets,
intent upon some piece of important business, his city eyes
awake upon a vision of the country, in the shape of that
very friend who so lately was rendering him so many acts
of kindness. The case is felt at once to be a scrape;—however,
he must make the best of it. With almost
breathless apprehension, he asks Mr Goodman what stay
he is going to make in town. What joy!—he goes within
an hour to Falkirk tryst! But, ah! this is but a short
relief. He comes back the day after to-morrow, and can
then spend a day. Well, a day it must be: it is all settled
in a moment, and, three minutes after having entered the
house, Mr Goodman finds himself shaken by the hand out
at the door, which is closed behind him ere he can well believe
that he has as yet seen his city friend. He walks a
little way in a confused state of mind, hardly able to say
distinctly that he is himself, or that his late guest is the
identical good fellow he seemed to be three months ago.
The whole appears a dream, and he thinks it must be hours
since he entered the house, though it is only minutes.
Falkirk tryst over, he comes back, and, at the appointed
hour, attends his city acquaintance, who, meanwhile, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
consulted with his spouse, has taken the opportunity,
since there was to be a dinner at any rate, to invite all the
stiff people he knows, in order to pay off his old debts.
The honest agriculturist gets a place among the rest, perhaps
a good one, but in such a scene he finds no entertainment,
and hardly gets a word of conversation with his
friend during the whole evening. At the proper hour he
rises to take his leave among the rest. The host inquires
when he leaves town—this is always a leading question
for a country friend—hears, to his unspeakable comfort,
that it is to be by the morning coach—and so good-night.
Of course, after this, there is little inducement for Mr
Goodman to send his daughters to spend a month in the
house of his city friend. The girls, however, do come in
somehow or other, and are living with some other person
on a visit, when one day, walking along the most crowded
and fashionable street, they meet their father’s friend arm
in arm with his wife. Seeing that they have first perceived
<em>him</em>, he runs forward in the kindest manner, and, after introducing
them to his partner, inquires after every particular
individual left at home. Some miscellaneous talk
ensues, and then, just at the skirts of the conversation,
when they are hovering on the point of separation, he
throws in, “You will be sure to see us some evening before
you leave town.” And then—and then there is no
more about it.</p>

<p>A varied case often occurs as follows:—A young lady
of perfect accomplishments, though of the middle ranks
of life, happens to be particularly convenient to a neighbouring
family of gentry in the country, where she is constantly
invited by them, and becomes the bosom friend of
all the young ladies, but only because her accomplishments
are useful to them as a means of spending their time. But
this acquaintance, though of use in the country, and there
felt as involving no risk of dignity, becomes inconvenient
when the parties happen to meet in town. The high-born
demoiselle, who elsewhere would have rushed into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
arms of her humble but ingenious friend, now tamely shakes
her hand, and, with cold complaisance, addresses her thus:
“Mamma is keeping no company this winter, but I dare
say she would be glad to see you some evening to tea: and—good-morning.”
Such is the world!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHERE_IS_MY_TRUNK">WHERE IS MY TRUNK?</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">It is well known in Scotland that the road from Edinburgh
to Dundee, though only forty-three miles in extent,
is rendered tedious and troublesome by the interposition
of two arms of the sea, namely, the Friths of Forth and
Tay, one of which is seven, and the other three miles
across. Several rapid and well-conducted stage-coaches
travel upon this road; but, from their frequent loading and
unloading at the ferries, there is not only considerable delay
to the travellers, but also rather more than the usual
risk of damage and loss to their luggage. On one occasion
it happened that the common chances against the safety
of a traveller’s integuments were multiplied in a mysterious,
but most amusing manner—as the following little
narrative will show.</p>

<p>The gentleman in question was an inside passenger—a
very tall man, which was so much the worse for him in that
situation—and it appeared that his whole baggage consisted
of a single black trunk—one of medium size, and no way
remarkable in appearance. On our leaving Edinburgh,
this trunk had been disposed in the boot of the coach,
amidst a great variety of other trunks, bundles, and carpet
bags, belonging to the rest of the passengers.</p>

<p>Having arrived at Newhaven, the luggage was brought
forth from the coach, and disposed upon a barrow, in order
that it might be taken down to the steam-boat which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
to convey us across. Just as the barrow was moving off,
the tall gentleman said,</p>

<p>“Guard, have you got my trunk?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” answered the guard; “you may be sure
it’s there.”</p>

<p>“Not so sure of that,” quoth the gentleman; “whereabouts
is it?”</p>

<p>The guard poked into the barrow, and looked in vain
among the numberless articles for the trunk. At length,
after he had noozled about for two or three minutes
through all the holes and corners of the mass of integuments,
he drew out his head, like a terrier tired of earthing
a badger, and seemed a little nonplussed.</p>

<p>“Why, here it is in the boot!” exclaimed the passenger,
“snug at the bottom, where it might have remained,
I suppose, for you, till safely returned to the coach-yard
in Edinburgh.”</p>

<p>The guard made an awkward apology, put the trunk
upon the barrow, and away we all went to the steam-boat.</p>

<p>Nothing farther occurred till we were all standing beside
the coach at Pettycur, ready to proceed on our journey
through Fife.</p>

<p>Every thing seemed to have been stowed into the coach,
and most of the passengers had taken their proper places,
when the tall gentleman cried out,</p>

<p>“Guard, where is my trunk?”</p>

<p>“In the boot, sir,” answered the guard; “you may depend
upon that.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen it put in,” said the passenger, “and
I don’t believe it is there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” said the guard, quite distressed, “there can
surely be no doubt about the trunk now.”</p>

<p>“There! I declare—there!” cried the owner of the
missing property; “my trunk is still lying down yonder
upon the sands. Don’t you see it? The sea, I declare,
is just about reaching it. What a careless set of porters!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
I protest I never was so treated on any journey
before.”</p>

<p>The trunk was instantly rescued from its somewhat
perilous situation, and, all having been at length put to
rights, we went on our way to Cupar.</p>

<p>Here the coach stops a few minutes at the inn, and
there is generally a partial discharge of passengers. As
some individuals, on the present occasion, had to leave
the coach, there was a slight discomposure of the luggage,
and various trunks and bundles were presently seen departing
on the backs of porters, after the gentlemen to
whom they belonged. After all seemed to have been
again put to rights, the tall gentleman made his wonted
inquiry respecting his trunk.</p>

<p>“The trunk, sir,” said the guard, rather pettishly, “is
in the boot.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said its owner, who in the meantime
had been peering about. “There it lies in the lobby of
the inn!”</p>

<p>The guard now began to think that this trunk was in
some way bewitched, and possessed a power, unenjoyed
by other earthly trunks, of removing itself or staying behind,
according to its own good pleasure.</p>

<p>“The Lord have a care o’ us!” cried the astonished
custodier of baggage, who, to do him justice, seemed an
exceedingly sober and attentive person. “The Lord have
a care o’ us, sir! That trunk’s no canny.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>“It’s <em>canny</em> enough, you fool,” said the gentleman
sharply; “but only you don’t pay proper attention to it.”</p>

<p>The fact was, that the trunk had been taken out of the
coach and placed in the lobby, in order to allow of certain
other articles being got at which lay beneath. It was now
once more stowed away, and we set forward upon the remaining
part of our journey, hoping that there would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
no more disturbance about this pestilent member of the
community of trunks. All was right till we came to the
lonely inn of St Michael’s, where a side-road turns off to
St Andrew’s, and where it happened that a passenger had
to leave us to walk to that seat of learning, a servant having
been in waiting to carry his luggage.</p>

<p>The tall gentleman, hearing a bustle about the boot,
projected his immensely long slender body through the
coach window, in order, like the lady in the fairy tale, to
see what he could see.</p>

<p>“Hollo, fellow!” cried he to the servant following the
gentleman down the St Andrew’s road; “is not that my
trunk? Come back, if you please, and let me inspect
it.”</p>

<p>“The trunk, sir,” interposed the guard, in a sententious
manner, “is that gemman’s trunk, and not yours: yours
is in the boot.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make sure of that, Mr Guard, if you please.
Come back, my good fellow, and let me see the trunk you
have got with you.”</p>

<p>The trunk was accordingly brought back, and, to the
confusion of the guard, who had thought himself fairly infallible
for this time, it was the tall man’s property, as clear
as brass nails could make it.</p>

<p>The trunk was now the universal subject of talk, both
inside and outside, and every body said he would be surprised
if it got to its journey’s end in safety. All agreed
that it manifested a most extraordinary disposition to be
lost, stolen, or strayed, but yet every one thought that
there was a kind of special providence about it, which kept
it on the right road after all; and, therefore, it became a
fair subject of debate, whether the chances <em>against</em>, or the
chances <em>for</em>, were likely to prevail.</p>

<p>Before we arrived at Newport, where we had to go on
board the ferry steam-boat for Dundee, the conversation
had gone into other channels, and, each being engaged
about his own concerns, no one thought any more about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
the trunk, till just as the barrow was descending along the
pier, the eternal long man cried out,</p>

<p>“Guard, have you got my trunk?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” cried the guard very promptly; “I’ve taken
care of it now. There it is on the top of all.”</p>

<p>“It’s no such thing,” cried a gentleman who had come
into the coach at Cupar; “that’s <em>my</em> trunk.”</p>

<p>Every body then looked about for the enchanted trunk;
the guard ran back, and once more searched the boot, which
he knew to have been searched to the bottom before; and
the tall gentleman gazed over land, water, and sky, in quest
of his necessary property.</p>

<p>“Well, guard,” cried he at length, “what a pretty fellow
you are! There, don’t you see?—there’s my trunk thrust
into the shed like a piece of lumber!”</p>

<p>And so it really was. At the head of the pier at Newport
there is a shed, with seats within, where people wait
for the ferry-boats; and there, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdu</i> beneath a form, lay
the enchanted trunk, having been so disposed, in the bustle
of unloading, by means which nobody could pretend to
understand. The guard, with a half-frightened look, approached
the awful object, and soon placed it with the
other things on board the ferry-boat.</p>

<p>On our landing at Dundee pier, the proprietor of the
trunk saw so well after it himself, that it was evident no
accident was for this time to be expected. However, it
appeared that this was only a lull to our attention. The
tall gentleman was to go on to Aberdeen by a coach then
just about to start from Merchant’s Inn; while I, for my
part, was to proceed by another coach, which was about to
proceed from the same place to Perth. A great bustle took
place in the narrow street at the inn door, and some of my
late fellow-travellers were getting into the one coach, and
some into the other. The Aberdeen coach was soonest
prepared to start, and, just as the guard cried “all’s right,”
the long figure devolved from the window, and said, in an
anxious tone of voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>“Guard, have you got my trunk?”</p>

<p>“Your trunk, sir!” cried the man; “what like is your
trunk?—we have nothing here but bags and baskets.”</p>

<p>“Heaven preserve me!” exclaimed the unfortunate gentleman,
and burst out of the coach.</p>

<p>It immediately appeared that the trunk had been deposited
by mistake in the Perth, instead of the Aberdeen
coach; and unless the owner had spoken, it would have
been, in less than an hour, half way up the Carse of
Gowrie. A transfer was immediately made, to the no
small amusement of myself and one or two other persons
in both coaches who had witnessed its previous misadventures
on the road through Fife. Seeing a friend on the
Aberdeen vehicle, I took an opportunity of privately requesting
that he would, on arriving at his destination, send
me an account by post of all the further mistakes and dangers
which were sure to befall the trunk in the course of
the journey. To this he agreed, and, about a week after,
I received the following letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear</span> ——,<br>
</p>

<p>“All went well with myself, my fellow travellers, and
<span class="smcap">the Trunk</span>, till we had got a few miles on this side of
Stonehaven, when, just as we were passing one of the
boggiest parts of the whole of that boggy road, an unfortunate
lurch threw us over upon one side, and the exterior
passengers, along with several heavy articles of luggage,
were all projected several yards off into the morass. As
the place was rather soft, nobody was much hurt; but,
after every thing had been again put to rights, the tall man
put some two-thirds of himself through the coach window,
in his usual manner, and asked the guard if he was sure the
trunk was safe in the boot.</p>

<p>“‘Oh Lord, sir!’ cried the guard, as if a desperate idea
had at that moment rushed into his mind; ‘the trunk was
on the top. Has nobody seen it lying about any where?’</p>

<p>“‘If it be a trunk ye’re looking after,’ cried a rustic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
very coolly, ‘I saw it sink into that well-ee<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a quarter of
an hour syne.’</p>

<p>“‘Good God!’ exclaimed the distracted owner, ‘my
trunk is gone for ever. Oh, my poor dear trunk!—where
is the place—show me where it disappeared!’</p>

<p>“The place being pointed out, he rushed madly up to
it, and seemed as if he would have plunged into the watery
profound to search for his lost property, or die in the attempt.
Being informed that the bogs in this part of the
country were perfectly bottomless, he soon saw how vain
every endeavour of that kind would be; and so he was
with difficulty induced to resume his place in the coach,
loudly threatening, however, to make the proprietors of
the vehicle pay sweetly for his loss.</p>

<p>“What was in the trunk, I have not been able to learn.
Perhaps the title-deeds of an estate were among the contents;
perhaps it was only filled with bricks and rags, in
order to impose upon the innkeepers. In all likelihood,
the mysterious object is still descending and descending,
like the angel’s hatchet in Rabbinical story, down the
groundless abyss: in which case its contents will not probably
be revealed till a great many things of more importance
and equal mystery are made plain.”</p>
